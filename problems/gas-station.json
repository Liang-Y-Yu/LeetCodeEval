You will be given:\n* A problem statement (with sample test cases if available).\n* A starter code snippet (with fixed function signatures).\n\nPlease write your solution in the python3 programming language. Your code must:\n* Solve the problem fully and correctly.\n* Pass all provided sample test cases.\n* Run within acceptable time and memory limits (assume large inputs if none are specified).\n* Follow good coding practices (clear logic, readable structure, appropriate use of language features).\n\nHere is the problem statement: There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the i^th station is gas[i].\nYou have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the i^th station to its next (i + 1)^th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.\nGiven two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.\n \nExample 1:\nInput: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nStart at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas.

Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5\nTravel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.\nTherefore, return 3 as the starting index.\nExample 2:\nInput: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation:\nYou can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.\nLet's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas.
