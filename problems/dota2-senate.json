You will be given:\n* A problem statement (with sample test cases if available).\n* A starter code snippet (with fixed function signatures).\n\nPlease write your solution in the python3 programming language. Your code must:\n* Solve the problem fully and correctly.\n* Pass all provided sample test cases.\n* Run within acceptable time and memory limits (assume large inputs if none are specified).\n* Follow good coding practices (clear logic, readable structure, appropriate use of language features).\n\nHere is the problem statement: In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.\nThe Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise one of the two rights:\n\tBan one senator's right: A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.\n\tAnnounce the victory: If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.\nGiven a string senate representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then if there are n senators, the size of the given string will be n.\nThe round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order.
