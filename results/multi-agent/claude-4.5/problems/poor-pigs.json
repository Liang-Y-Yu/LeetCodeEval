      "Answer": "=== ANALYSIS ===\nLooking at this problem, I need to analyze it step by step.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n**1. Problem Type Classification**: \n- Information Theory / Math / Combinatorics\n- This is fundamentally about encoding information and maximizing information gain from tests\n\n**2. Key Patterns & Algorithms**:\n- Each pig can be in multiple states based on when it dies (or doesn't die)\n- With `minutesToTest / minutesToDie` tests possible, each pig can distinguish between `(minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1` states\n- This is a base conversion problem: we need `pigs` such that `(tests + 1)^pigs >= buckets`\n\n**3. Constraints Analysis**:\n- Small input sizes (buckets \u2264 1000), so O(log n) solutions are fine\n- Need to find minimum number of pigs\n\n**4. Edge Cases**:\n- buckets = 1 (need 0 pigs)\n- Only 1 test possible (each pig has 2 states: dead or alive)\n- Multiple tests possible (each pig has more states based on timing)\n\n**5. Input/Output Analysis**:\n- Input: Three integers (buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest)\n- Output: Single integer (minimum number of pigs)\n\n**6. Difficulty Assessment**:\n- The challenge is recognizing this as an information theory problem\n- Understanding that each pig can represent multiple states (not just binary)\n- Each pig can die at different time intervals, creating `tests + 1` possible outcomes\n\n## Solution Approach\n\nThe key insight is that if we have `tests` rounds of testing:\n- Each pig can be in `tests + 1` states (dies after test 1, test 2, ..., test n, or survives)\n- With `p` pigs, we can distinguish between `(tests + 1)^p` different buckets\n- We need the minimum `p` where `(tests + 1)^p >= buckets`\n\nFor example:\n- If tests = 1 (like Example 1): each pig has 2 states, so with 2 pigs we can handle 2^2 = 4 buckets\n- If tests = 2 (like Example 2): each pig has 3 states, so with 2 pigs we can handle 3^2 = 9 buckets\n\nWait, let me reconsider Example 2:\n- minutesToTest = 30, minutesToDie = 15\n- Number of tests = 30/15 = 2\n- With 2 tests, each pig has 3 possible states: dies at time 15, dies at time 30, or survives\n- But the example shows a different strategy with only 2 states being used\n\nActually, looking more carefully at Example 2, they're using 2 rounds but each pig only has 2 effective states in their explanation. Let me recalculate:\n- tests = minutesToTest / minutesToDie = 30 / 15 = 2\n- But we can only perform tests at times 0, 15, and get results at 15, 30\n- So we have 2 testing opportunities, meaning tests = 2\n- Each pig has (tests + 1) = 3 states: dies after first test, dies after second test, never dies\n\nWith 2 pigs and 3 states each: 3^2 = 9 buckets possible, which is more than 4, so 2 pigs suffice.\n\nThe formula is: Find minimum `pigs` where `(tests + 1)^pigs >= buckets`\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:\n        if buckets == 1:\n            return 0\n        \n        tests = minutesToTest // minutesToDie\n        states = tests + 1\n        \n        pigs = 0\n        while states ** pigs < buckets:\n            pigs += 1\n        \n        return pigs\n```\n\n=== DESIGN ===\nLooking at this problem, I need to recognize it as an information theory problem where each pig can represent multiple states based on when it dies.\n\n## Solution Design\n\n**1. Algorithm Choice**: \nMathematical approach using logarithms and base conversion. We need to find the minimum number of pigs where `(states)^pigs >= buckets`, where `states = (minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1`.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Approach**:\n- Calculate the number of test rounds: `tests = minutesToTest // minutesToDie`\n- Each pig can be in `states = tests + 1` different states (dies after test 1, test 2, ..., test n, or never dies)\n- Find minimum `pigs` such that `states^pigs >= buckets`\n- This can be solved by incrementing pigs until the condition is met, or using logarithms\n\n**3. Data Structures**:\n- Only primitive integers needed for calculations\n\n**4. Time Complexity**: \nO(log(buckets)) - the number of pigs needed grows logarithmically with buckets\n\n**5. Space Complexity**: \nO(1) - only constant space for variables\n\n**6. Pseudocode**:\n```\nfunction poorPigs(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest):\n    if buckets == 1:\n        return 0\n    \n    tests = minutesToTest // minutesToDie\n    states = tests + 1\n    \n    pigs = 0\n    while states^pigs < buckets:\n        pigs += 1\n    \n    return pigs\n```\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:\n        if buckets == 1:\n            return 0\n        \n        tests = minutesToTest // minutesToDie\n        states = tests + 1\n        \n        pigs = 0\n        while states ** pigs < buckets:\n            pigs += 1\n        \n        return pigs\n```\n\n=== IMPLEMENTATION ===\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:\n        if buckets == 1:\n            return 0\n        \n        tests = minutesToTest // minutesToDie\n        states = tests + 1\n        \n        pigs = 0\n        while states ** pigs < buckets:\n            pigs += 1\n        \n        return pigs\n```\n\n=== VERIFICATION ===\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:\n        if buckets == 1:\n            return 0\n        \n        tests = minutesToTest // minutesToDie\n        states = tests + 1\n        \n        pigs = 0\n        while states ** pigs < buckets:\n            pigs += 1\n        \n        return pigs\n```\n\n",
