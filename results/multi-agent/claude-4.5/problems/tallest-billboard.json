      "Answer": "=== ANALYSIS ===\nLooking at this problem, I need to analyze it thoroughly before providing a solution.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n1. **Problem Type Classification**: Dynamic Programming, Partition Problem, Subset Sum variant\n\n2. **Key Patterns & Algorithms**: \n   - This is a variant of the partition problem where we need to find two disjoint subsets with equal sums\n   - Dynamic Programming with state tracking (difference between two supports)\n   - We need to maximize the height while maintaining equal support heights\n\n3. **Constraints Analysis**:\n   - `rods.length <= 20`: Small enough for exponential approaches, but DP is more efficient\n   - `sum(rods[i]) <= 5000`: This bounds our DP state space\n   - The key insight: we can track the difference between two supports, which ranges from -5000 to 5000\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Only one or two rods that can't be balanced\n   - All rods must go to one side\n   - Empty result (return 0)\n   - Single rod (impossible to balance)\n\n5. **Input/Output Analysis**:\n   - Input: List of positive integers (rod lengths)\n   - Output: Single integer (maximum height of equal supports, or 0 if impossible)\n\n6. **Difficulty Assessment**:\n   - Hard problem because:\n     - Not obvious that it's a DP problem\n     - State representation is tricky (tracking difference)\n     - Need to partition into two equal-sum subsets while maximizing the sum\n\n## Solution Approach\n\nThe key insight is to use DP where we track the **difference** between two supports. For each rod, we have 3 choices:\n1. Add to support 1\n2. Add to support 2  \n3. Don't use it\n\nWe'll use `dp[diff]` to represent the maximum height of the taller support when the difference between supports is `diff`.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def tallestBillboard(self, rods: List[int]) -> int:\n        dp = {0: 0}\n        \n        for rod in rods:\n            new_dp = dp.copy()\n            \n            for diff, taller in dp.items():\n                shorter = taller - diff\n                \n                new_diff1 = diff + rod\n                new_taller1 = taller + rod\n                if new_diff1 not in new_dp or new_dp[new_diff1] < new_taller1:\n                    new_dp[new_diff1] = new_taller1\n                \n                new_diff2 = abs(diff - rod)\n                if diff >= rod:\n                    new_taller2 = taller\n                else:\n                    new_taller2 = shorter + rod\n                if new_diff2 not in new_dp or new_dp[new_diff2] < new_taller2:\n                    new_dp[new_diff2] = new_taller2\n            \n            dp = new_dp\n        \n        return dp.get(0, 0)\n```\n\n=== DESIGN ===\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def tallestBillboard(self, rods: List[int]) -> int:\n        dp = {0: 0}\n        \n        for rod in rods:\n            new_dp = dp.copy()\n            \n            for diff, taller in dp.items():\n                shorter = taller - diff\n                \n                new_diff1 = diff + rod\n                new_taller1 = taller + rod\n                if new_diff1 not in new_dp or new_dp[new_diff1] < new_taller1:\n                    new_dp[new_diff1] = new_taller1\n                \n                new_diff2 = abs(diff - rod)\n                if diff >= rod:\n                    new_taller2 = taller\n                else:\n                    new_taller2 = shorter + rod\n                if new_diff2 not in new_dp or new_dp[new_diff2] < new_taller2:\n                    new_dp[new_diff2] = new_taller2\n            \n            dp = new_dp\n        \n        return dp.get(0, 0)\n```\n\n=== IMPLEMENTATION ===\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def tallestBillboard(self, rods: List[int]) -> int:\n        dp = {0: 0}\n        \n        for rod in rods:\n            new_dp = dp.copy()\n            \n            for diff, taller in dp.items():\n                shorter = taller - diff\n                \n                new_diff1 = diff + rod\n                new_taller1 = taller + rod\n                if new_diff1 not in new_dp or new_dp[new_diff1] < new_taller1:\n                    new_dp[new_diff1] = new_taller1\n                \n                new_diff2 = abs(diff - rod)\n                if diff >= rod:\n                    new_taller2 = taller\n                else:\n                    new_taller2 = shorter + rod\n                if new_diff2 not in new_dp or new_dp[new_diff2] < new_taller2:\n                    new_dp[new_diff2] = new_taller2\n            \n            dp = new_dp\n        \n        return dp.get(0, 0)\n```\n\n=== VERIFICATION ===\nLooking at this problem, I need to find two disjoint subsets of rods with equal sums and maximize that sum.\n\nLet me verify the provided solution approach:\n\nThe solution uses dynamic programming where `dp[diff]` represents the maximum height of the shorter support when the difference between the two supports is `diff`.\n\nActually, reviewing the code more carefully, I see there's a conceptual issue. Let me trace through Example 1:\n- rods = [1,2,3,6]\n- Expected output: 6\n\nThe approach should track: for each difference between two supports, what's the maximum value of the taller support.\n\nLet me reconsider: `dp[diff]` should represent the maximum height of one support (let's say the shorter or a reference support) when the difference is `diff`.\n\nA cleaner approach: `dp[diff]` = maximum height of the shorter support when difference between supports is `diff`.\n\nFor each rod, we can:\n1. Add it to the taller support: `new_diff = diff + rod`, taller stays as reference\n2. Add it to the shorter support: difference changes based on whether it equalizes or reverses\n3. Don't use it (handled by copying dp)\n\nLet me implement a corrected version:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def tallestBillboard(self, rods: List[int]) -> int:\n        dp = {0: 0}\n        \n        for rod in rods:\n            new_dp = dp.copy()\n            \n            for diff, shorter_height in dp.items():\n                new_dp[diff + rod] = max(new_dp.get(diff + rod, 0), shorter_height)\n                \n                new_diff = abs(diff - rod)\n                new_shorter = min(shorter_height + rod, shorter_height + diff)\n                if diff >= rod:\n                    new_shorter = shorter_height\n                else:\n                    new_shorter = shorter_height + rod - diff\n                new_dp[new_diff] = max(new_dp.get(new_diff, 0), new_shorter)\n            \n            dp = new_dp\n        \n        return dp.get(0, 0)\n```\n\nWait, let me think about this more carefully. The standard solution to this problem is:\n\n`dp[diff]` = maximum value of the smaller support when the difference between two supports is `diff`.\n\nFor each rod, we have 3 choices:\n1. Add to the larger support: diff becomes diff + rod\n2. Add to the smaller support: diff becomes |diff - rod|\n3. Skip it\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def tallestBillboard(self, rods: List[int]) -> int:\n        dp = {0: 0}\n        \n        for rod in rods:\n            new_dp = dp.copy()\n            for diff, h in dp.items():\n                new_dp[diff + rod] = max(new_dp.get(diff + rod, 0), h)\n                new_diff = abs(diff - rod)\n                new_h = h + min(diff, rod)\n                new_dp[new_diff] = max(new_dp.get(new_diff, 0), new_h)\n            dp = new_dp\n        \n        return dp[0]\n```\n\n",
