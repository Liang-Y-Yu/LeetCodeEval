      "Answer": "=== ANALYSIS ===\n**Problem Analysis:**\n\nThe problem involves finding the shortest sequence of instructions (A and R) for a car to reach a target position on an infinite number line. The car starts at position 0 with speed +1. The instructions modify the position and speed in a specific way. This is a classic shortest path problem in a state space.\n\n1. **Problem Type Classification**: \n   - Graph Theory / State-Space Search (BFS)\n   - Dynamic Programming (with state: position and speed)\n\n2. **Key Patterns & Algorithms**:\n   - Since we are looking for the shortest path, Breadth-First Search (BFS) is suitable. Each state can be represented by (position, speed). However, the state space might be large.\n   - Alternatively, Dynamic Programming can be used with state (pos, speed) but the speed can grow exponentially. However, note that the target is at most 10^4, so we can bound the state.\n   - Important observation: The car can overshoot the target and then come back. Also, reversing changes the direction and resets the speed to \u00b11.\n\n3. **Constraints Analysis**:\n   - target is between 1 and 10000.\n   - For BFS: The number of states might be large. However, we can restrict the position to be within [0, 2*target] (because going beyond 2*target is unlikely to be optimal) and the speed to be powers of 2 (with sign). Actually, the speed is always \u00b12^k for some k>=0.\n   - We need to avoid infinite states. We can use a visited set with (pos, speed) to avoid cycles.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - target=0 (but constraints say at least 1).\n   - target=1.\n   - Cases where we need to reverse multiple times.\n   - Cases where we overshoot and then reverse to come back.\n\n5. **Input/Output Analysis**:\n   - Input: integer target.\n   - Output: integer length of the shortest instruction sequence.\n\n6. **Difficulty Assessment**:\n   - The challenge lies in the state space: the speed grows exponentially, and reversing creates many possibilities.\n   - Naive BFS might be too slow if we don't bound the states properly.\n   - We need to avoid redundant states: same position and same speed (because same state will lead to same future).\n\n**Solution Design with BFS:**\n\nWe will use BFS to explore states. Each state is (pos, speed). We start at (0,1). For each state, we can do:\n   - 'A': new_pos = pos + speed, new_speed = speed * 2.\n   - 'R': new_pos = pos, new_speed = -1 if speed>0 else 1.\n\nWe want to find the minimum number of instructions to reach the target.\n\nTo avoid infinite states:\n   - We bound the position: it should not be too far from 0 and target. Actually, we can set a lower bound (e.g., -target) and an upper bound (e.g., 2*target). But note: going negative is allowed.\n   - Alternatively, we can use a visited dictionary with key (pos, speed). However, the speed can be large. But note: speed is always \u00b12^k. So we can represent state as (pos, k, sign) but actually we can just use (pos, speed).\n\nHowever, the speed might become very large. But if the position is beyond 2*target, it might not be useful. So we can prune states where |pos| > 2 * target.\n\nImplementation:\n   - Use a queue: (steps, pos, speed)\n   - visited: set of (pos, speed)\n\nBut note: the speed can be large. However, if we prune by position, the speed will not be too large: because if we are at pos beyond 2*target, we stop. So the speed will be at most 2*target? Actually, no: because speed is multiplied by 2 each time. But if we bound the position, the speed will be bounded by 2*target? Not exactly. However, we can also prune if speed is too large (e.g., |speed| > 2*target). But actually, it is safe to just bound the position.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a DP array for positions up to 2*target, and for each position store the best steps for different speeds? But the speeds are powers of two.\n\nAnother idea: use Dijkstra (but steps are always 1 per instruction, so BFS is fine).\n\nLet's implement BFS with:\n   - visited: dictionary keyed by (pos, speed). Actually, we can use a set.\n   - We start at (0,1) with steps=0.\n   - For each state, generate two neighbors.\n   - If we reach target, return steps.\n\nBut worst-case: the state space is O(target * log(target))? Because speed is powers of two and there are about log2(target) different speeds. So total states O(target * log(target)) which is acceptable for target=10000? (10000 * 14 = 140000 states). So it is manageable.\n\nHowever, we must avoid states that are too far. We will set:\n   - position must be between -target and 2*target? Actually, we can set from -10000 to 20000.\n\nBut to be safe, we can set:\n   if new_pos < -target or new_pos > 2*target: skip.\n\nWhy 2*target? Because if we are beyond 2*target, we need to reverse and come back, but it might not be optimal to go that far. Actually, it is known that the optimal solution won't go beyond 2*target.\n\nSo code:\n\nfrom collections import deque\nclass Solution:\n    def racecar(self, target: int) -> int:\n        # BFS\n        queue = deque()\n        queue.append((0, 1, 0))  # (pos, speed, steps)\n        visited = set()\n        visited.add((0,1))\n        \n        while queue:\n            pos, speed, steps = queue.popleft()\n            if pos == target:\n                return steps\n            # Instruction A\n            new_pos = pos + speed\n            new_speed = speed * 2\n            state1 = (new_pos, new_speed)\n            if state1 not in visited and new_pos >= -target and new_pos <= 2*target:\n                visited.add(state1)\n                queue.append((new_pos, new_speed, steps+1))\n            \n            # Instruction R\n            new_speed = -1 if speed > 0 else 1\n            state2 = (pos, new_speed)\n            if state2 not in visited and pos >= -target and pos <= 2*target:\n                visited.add(state2)\n                queue.append((pos, new_speed, steps+1))\n\nBut note: we are including negative positions. This should work.\n\nHowever, we must test with small cases.\n\nTest with target=3:\n   Steps: \n        Start: (0,1,0)\n        Then from (0,1): \n            A: (1,2,1)\n            R: (0,-1,1)\n        Then from (1,2):\n            A: (3,4,2) -> found target, return 2.
