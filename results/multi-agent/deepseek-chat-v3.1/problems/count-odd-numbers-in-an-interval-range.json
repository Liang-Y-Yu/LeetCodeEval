      "Prompt": "Multi-agent approach:\n1. Analysis\n2. Design\n3. Implementation\n4. Verification",
      "Answer": "=== ANALYSIS ===\nGiven the problem and constraints, let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Problem Type Classification**: This is a simple math problem. It does not require complex data structures or algorithms.\n\n2. **Key Patterns & Algorithms**: The solution can be derived using a mathematical formula to count the number of odd numbers in a range without iterating through all numbers (which would be inefficient for large inputs).\n\n3. **Constraints Analysis**: The constraints (0 <= low <= high <= 10^9) mean that we cannot iterate from low to high (which would be O(n)) because 10^9 is a billion. We need a constant time solution O(1).\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - When low equals high (only one number).\n   - When both low and high are even.\n   - When both low and high are odd.\n   - When one is even and the other is odd.\n   - When low is 0 (0 is even).\n\n5. **Input/Output Analysis**: The input is two integers (low and high). The output is a single integer (count of odd numbers between low and high inclusive).\n\n6. **Difficulty Assessment**: This is an easy problem. The challenge is to avoid iterating and instead use a mathematical approach.\n\n**Solution Insight**:\nThe number of odd numbers between 1 and n inclusive is (n+1)//2.\nSo, the number of odds from 0 to high is (high+1)//2.\nSimilarly, the number of odds from 0 to low-1 is (low)//2.\nTherefore, the count of odds between low and high inclusive is: ((high+1)//2) - (low//2)\n\nLet's verify with examples:\nExample 1: low=3, high=7 -> \n   (7+1)//2 = 4, (3//2)=1 -> 4-1=3 (correct).\nExample 2: low=8, high=10 -> \n   (10+1)//2=5, (8//2)=4 -> 5-4=1 (correct).\n\nThis formula works because:\n- If low is even, low//2 is the count of odds from 0 to low-1 (which is correct since low is not included).\n- If low is odd, low//2 is still the count of odds from 0 to low-1 (so we are excluding low, which we want to include? Actually no: we are subtracting the odds from 0 to low-1 from the odds from 0 to high. So if low is odd, we are excluding it in the subtraction? But wait, (low//2) for an odd low: e.g., low=3 -> 3//2=1 (which is the count of odds from 0 to 2: which are [1] -> correct, so we are excluding 3? Actually no, because we want to include low. However, the formula for high includes high, and the subtraction of the lower part (which goes only to low-1) ensures that low is included. So it works.\n\nAnother way: \nTotal odds = (number of odds from 0 to high) - (number of odds from 0 to low-1)\nWhich is exactly: ((high+1)//2) - ((low-1+1)//2) = ((high+1)//2) - (low//2)\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nNow, code accordingly.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:\n        return (high + 1) // 2 - low // 2\n```\n\n=== DESIGN ===\n**Algorithm Choice**: Mathematical formula to compute the count of odd numbers in a range without iteration.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach**:\n1. Calculate the number of odd numbers from 0 to high inclusive: (high + 1) // 2.\n2. Calculate the number of odd numbers from 0 to (low - 1) inclusive: low // 2.\n3. Subtract the second result from the first to get the count of odd numbers between low and high inclusive.\n\n**Data Structures**: None needed, as we are using integer arithmetic.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(1), constant time operations.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1), no extra space used.\n\n**Pseudocode**:\n```\nfunction countOdds(low, high):\n    return ((high + 1) // 2) - (low // 2)\n```\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:\n        return (high + 1) // 2 - low // 2\n```\n\n=== IMPLEMENTATION ===\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:\n        return (high + 1) // 2 - low // 2\n```\n\n=== VERIFICATION ===\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:\n        return (high + 1) // 2 - low // 2\n```\n\n",
