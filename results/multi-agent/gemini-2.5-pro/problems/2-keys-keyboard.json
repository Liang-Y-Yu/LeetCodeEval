      "Answer": "=== ANALYSIS ===\nAn elegant and efficient solution to this problem stems from a number-theoretic insight. The process of generating `n` characters can be viewed as a sequence of multiplications. If we have `k` characters on screen, we can produce `m*k` characters by performing one `Copy All` operation and `m-1` `Paste` operations. This sequence takes a total of `m` steps.\n\nLet `ops(n)` be the minimum operations to get `n` characters. If we form `n` from `k` characters where `n = m*k`, then `ops(n) = ops(k) + m`. By applying this logic recursively, we find that if `n` has a prime factorization of `p1 * p2 * ... * pk`, the minimum number of operations is the sum of its prime factors, `p1 + p2 + ... + pk`.\n\nFor example, to get 12 'A's (`12 = 2 * 2 * 3`):\n1. Get 2 'A's from 1 'A': Copy 'A', Paste 'A'. `ops(2) = 2`.\n2. Get 4 'A's from 2 'A's: Copy 'AA', Paste 'AA'. `ops(4) = ops(2) + 2 = 4`.\n3. Get 12 'A's from 4 'A's: Copy 'AAAA', Paste 'AAAA' twice. `ops(12) = ops(4) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7`.\nThe total steps `7` is the sum of prime factors `2 + 2 + 3`.\n\nThis simplifies the problem to finding the prime factorization of `n` and summing the factors. The algorithm iteratively divides `n` by its smallest prime factors, starting from 2, adding each factor to a running total. This approach is highly efficient, with a time complexity of roughly O(sqrt(n)).\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minSteps(self, n: int) -> int:\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        \n        ans = 0\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= n:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                ans += d\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        \n        if n > 1:\n            ans += n\n            \n        return ans\n\n```\n\n=== DESIGN ===\nAn elegant and efficient solution to this problem stems from a number-theoretic insight.

The algorithm iteratively divides `n` by its smallest prime factors, starting from 2, adding each factor to a running total. This approach is highly efficient, with a time complexity of roughly O(sqrt(n)).\n\n### 1. Algorithm Choice\nThe chosen approach is **iterative prime factorization**. Based on the problem analysis, the minimum number of operations to obtain `n` characters is equivalent to the sum of the prime factors of `n`. This transforms the problem from a dynamic programming or search problem into a number theory problem.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Approach\n1.  Handle the base case: If `n` is 1, no operations are needed, so the result is 0.\n2.  Initialize a variable, `total_operations`, to 0. This will accumulate the sum of the prime factors.\n3.  Start with the smallest prime number, `d = 2`, as a potential divisor.\n4.  Iterate through potential divisors. A key optimization is to only check divisors `d` up to the square root of the current `n`.\n5.  In an inner loop, for the current divisor `d`, repeatedly check if `n` is divisible by `d`.\n    - If it is, add `d` to `total_operations` (as `d` is a prime factor).\n    - Update `n` by dividing it by `d` (`n = n / d`).\n    - Continue this until `n` is no longer divisible by `d`.\n6.  Increment `d` to check the next potential divisor.\n7.  After the main loop finishes, if the value of `n` is still greater than 1, it means the remaining `n` is a prime factor itself. Add this final value of `n` to `total_operations`.\n8.  Return the final `total_operations` sum.\n\n### 3. Data Structures\n-   `n`: An integer to hold the input number, which is modified during factorization.\n-   `total_operations`: An integer to accumulate the sum of the prime factors.\n-   `d`: An integer to represent the current divisor being tested.\nNo complex data structures are required.\n\n### 4. Time Complexity\nThe time complexity is **O(sqrt(n))**. The outer loop iterates from `d = 2` up to `sqrt(n)`. The inner while loop, which divides `n`, reduces `n` significantly. Across all iterations, the total number of divisions is logarithmic, but the main cost comes from iterating `d` up to `sqrt(n)`.\n\n### 5. Space Complexity\nThe space complexity is **O(1)**. The algorithm uses a fixed number of variables regardless of the input size `n`, resulting in constant space usage.\n\n### 6. Pseudocode\n```\nfunction minSteps(n):\n    // Base case: 1 'A' is the initial state, requiring 0 steps.\n    if n == 1:\n        return 0\n\n    total_operations = 0\n    d = 2\n\n    // Iterate through potential divisors up to sqrt(n).\n    while d * d <= n:\n        // If d is a factor, add it to the total and divide n by it.\n        while n % d == 0:\n            total_operations = total_operations + d\n            n = n / d\n        \n        d = d + 1\n\n    // If n is still > 1, it must be the last prime factor.\n    if n > 1:\n        total_operations = total_operations + n\n\n    return total_operations\n\n```\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minSteps(self, n: int) -> int:\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        \n        ans = 0\n        d = 2\n        # Iterate through potential divisors up to the square root of n\n        while d * d <= n:\n            # While d is a factor of n, it is part of the prime factorization.\n            # Add d to the answer and divide n by d.\n            while n % d == 0:\n                ans += d\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        \n        # If n is still greater than 1 after the loop, it means the remaining\n        # n is a prime factor itself.\n        if n > 1:\n            ans += n\n            \n        return ans\n```\n\n=== IMPLEMENTATION ===\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minSteps(self, n: int) -> int:\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        \n        ans = 0\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= n:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                ans += d\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        \n        if n > 1:\n            ans += n\n            \n        return ans\n```\n\n=== VERIFICATION ===\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minSteps(self, n: int) -> int:\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        \n        ans = 0\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= n:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                ans += d\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        \n        if n > 1:\n            ans += n\n            \n        return ans\n```\n\n",
