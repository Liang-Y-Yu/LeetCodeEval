      "Answer": "=== ANALYSIS ===\nAn elegant and effective solution involves pre-calculating the results for all possible prefix-suffix pairs and storing them in a hash map. This approach trades increased initialization time and memory for very fast query times, which is suitable given the problem constraints (many queries after a single initialization).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialization (`__init__`)**:\n    *   We create a dictionary (hash map) to store our precomputed results. The keys will be `(prefix, suffix)` tuples, and the values will be the word indices.\n    *   We iterate through the input `words` array, keeping track of each `word` and its `index`.\n    *   For each `word`, we generate all its possible prefixes and all its possible suffixes. A word of length `L` has `L+1` prefixes (including the empty string and the full word) and `L+1` suffixes.\n    *   For every generated `(prefix, suffix)` pair, we store the current `word`'s `index` in our dictionary.\n    *   Crucially, since we iterate through the `words` in their original order (from index 0 to N-1), if a `(prefix, suffix)` pair appears in multiple words, our dictionary will be updated sequentially. The final value stored for that key will naturally be the largest index, fulfilling the problem's requirement.\n\n2.  **Query (`f`)**:\n    *   The `f` function becomes a simple dictionary lookup.\n    *   We query the dictionary with the provided `(pref, suff)` tuple as the key.\n    *   If the key exists, we return the stored index.\n    *   If the key is not found (meaning no word in the original list matches the criteria), we return -1. Python's `dict.get(key, default)` method is perfect for this.\n\n**Complexity Analysis**:\n*   Let `N` be the number of words and `L` be the maximum length of a word.\n*   **Time Complexity**:\n    *   `__init__`: `O(N * L^3)`. For each of the `N` words, we generate `O(L^2)` prefix-suffix pairs. Creating each pair and its hash takes `O(L)` time due to string slicing and hashing. Since `L` is small (\u2264 7), this is computationally feasible.\n    *   `f`: `O(L)`. The query time is proportional to the length of the key (`pref` and `suff`), which is very fast.\n*   **Space Complexity**: `O(N * L^3)`. The dictionary stores `O(N * L^2)` keys. The space for each key is `O(L)`. This is the main trade-off but is manageable given the constraints.\n\nThis approach is both correct and efficient enough to pass within the given time and memory limits.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass WordFilter:\n\n    def __init__(self, words: List[str]):\n        self.cache = {}\n        \n        for index, word in enumerate(words):\n            word_len = len(word)\n            \n            for i in range(word_len + 1):\n                prefix = word[:i]\n                for j in range(word_len + 1):\n                    suffix = word[word_len - j:]\n                    self.cache[(prefix, suffix)] = index\n\n    def f(self, pref: str, suff: str) -> int:\n        return self.cache.get((pref, suff), -1)\n\n```\n\n=== DESIGN ===\nAn elegant and effective solution involves pre-calculating the results for all possible prefix-suffix pairs and storing them in a hash map.

The query time is proportional to the length of the key (`pref` and `suff`), which is very fast.\\*   **Space Complexity**: `O(N * L^3)`. The dictionary stores `O(N * L^2)` keys. The space for each key is `O(L)`. This is the main trade-off but is manageable given the constraints.This approach is both correct and efficient enough to pass within the given time and memory limits.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass WordFilter:\n\n    def __init__(self, words: List[str]):\n        self.cache = {}\n        for index, word in enumerate(words):\n            word_len = len(word)\n            for i in range(word_len + 1):\n                prefix = word[:i]\n                for j in range(word_len + 1):\n                    suffix = word[word_len - j:]\n                    self.cache[(prefix, suffix)] = index\n\n    def f(self, pref: str, suff: str) -> int:\n        return self.cache.get((pref, suff), -1)\n\n```\n\n=== IMPLEMENTATION ===\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass WordFilter:\n    def __init__(self, words: List[str]):\n        self.cache = {}\n        for index, word in enumerate(words):\n            word_len = len(word)\n            for i in range(word_len + 1):\n                prefix = word[:i]\n                for j in range(word_len + 1):\n                    suffix = word[word_len - j:]\n                    self.cache[(prefix, suffix)] = index\n\n    def f(self, pref: str, suff: str) -> int:\n        return self.cache.get((pref, suff), -1)\n\n```\n\n=== VERIFICATION ===\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass WordFilter:\n    def __init__(self, words: List[str]):\n        self.cache = {}\n        for index, word in enumerate(words):\n            word_len = len(word)\n            # Generate all prefixes\n            for i in range(word_len + 1):\n                prefix = word[:i]\n                # Generate all suffixes\n                for j in range(word_len + 1):\n                    suffix = word[word_len - j:]\n                    # Store the index for the (prefix, suffix) pair.\n                    # Since we iterate from left to right, this will\n                    # automatically store the largest index.\n                    self.cache[(prefix, suffix)] = index\n\n    def f(self, pref: str, suff: str) -> int:\n        # Retrieve the index from the cache.\n        # If the pair is not found, get() returns the default value -1.\n        return self.cache.get((pref, suff), -1)\n\n```\n\n",
