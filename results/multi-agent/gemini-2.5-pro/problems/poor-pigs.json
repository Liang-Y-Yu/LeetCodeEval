      "Answer": "=== ANALYSIS ===\nAn elegant solution to this problem stems from an information-theoretic perspective. The challenge is to determine how many unique outcomes we can distinguish with a given number of pigs and a set amount of time. Each unique outcome can identify a unique bucket.\n\n### **Core Insight: Pigs as Digits in a Custom Number System**\n\n1.  **Test Rounds**: First, let's determine how many experiments we can run. Each test requires `minutesToDie` to see the result. With `minutesToTest` total time, we can conduct `k = minutesToTest // minutesToDie` sequential test rounds.\n\n2.  **States of a Single Pig**: For any single pig, there are several possible outcomes across these `k` rounds:\n    *   It could die in the 1st test round.\n    *   It could die in the 2nd test round.\n    *   ...\n    *   It could die in the `k`-th test round.\n    *   It could survive all tests.\n\n    This means a single pig can provide `k + 1` distinct pieces of information. Let's call this number `B = k + 1`. This value `B` will be the base of our \"number system\".\n\n3.  **States of Multiple Pigs**: If we have `p` pigs, and each pig can independently be in one of `B` states, the total number of combined, distinguishable outcomes is `B * B * ... * B` (`p` times), which is `B^p`.\n\n4.  **The Equation**: Each of these `B^p` outcomes can be used to uniquely identify a poisonous bucket. Therefore, to be able to identify the single poisonous bucket among `N` buckets, we need the total number of distinguishable outcomes to be at least `N`. This gives us the core inequality:\n\n    `B^p >= buckets`\n    or\n    `(minutesToTest // minutesToDie + 1)^p >= buckets`\n\n5.  **Solving for `p`**: Our goal is to find the minimum integer `p` (number of pigs) that satisfies this inequality. We can solve this by starting with `p = 0` and incrementing `p` until the condition is met.\n\n    *   With `p = 0` pigs, we can distinguish `B^0 = 1` outcome (no pigs die). This works if there's only 1 bucket.\n    *   With `p = 1` pig, we can distinguish `B^1 = B` outcomes.\n    *   With `p = 2` pigs, we can distinguish `B^2` outcomes, and so on.\n\n    This iterative approach is efficient and avoids potential floating-point precision issues that might arise from using a logarithmic formula like `p = ceil(log_B(buckets))`.\n\n### **Example Walkthrough (`buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 30`)**\n\n1.  `k = 30 // 15 = 2` test rounds are possible.\n2.  `B = k + 1 = 3`. Each pig has 3 possible states (die in round 1, die in round 2, or survive).\n3.  We need `3^p >= 4`.\n    *   If `p = 1`: `3^1 = 3`. Not enough to distinguish 4 buckets.\n    *   If `p = 2`: `3^2 = 9`. This is enough to distinguish 4 buckets.\n4.  The minimum number of pigs needed is `2`.\n\nThis logic directly translates into a simple and efficient algorithm.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the minimum number of pigs required to find the poisonous bucket.\n\n        The problem can be solved by thinking about it in terms of information theory.\n        Each pig can provide information about the poisonous bucket. The amount of\n        information depends on how many states we can observe for each pig.\n\n        1.  Calculate the number of test rounds possible:\n            - Each test takes `minutesToDie`. Total time is `minutesToTest`.\n            - `num_tests = minutesToTest // minutesToDie`\n\n        2.  Determine the number of states per pig:\n            - A pig can die in any of the `num_tests` rounds, or it can survive.\n            - This gives `num_tests + 1` possible outcomes (states) for each pig.\n            - Let `base = num_tests + 1`. This is the base of our \"information system\".\n\n        3.  Find the number of pigs (`p`):\n            - With `p` pigs, we can distinguish `base^p` total outcomes.\n            - Each outcome can be mapped to a unique bucket.\n            - We need to find the smallest integer `p` such that `base^p >= buckets`.\n\n        4.  Implementation:\n            - We can solve `base^p >= buckets` by iteratively increasing `p`.\n            - Start with `pigs = 0`. With 0 pigs, we can test `base^0 = 1` bucket.\n            - In a loop, multiply the number of testable buckets by `base` and\n              increment `pigs` until we can cover all `buckets`.\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        # The number of states a single pig can represent.\n        # It's the number of test rounds plus one for surviving.\n        states_per_pig = (minutesToTest // minutesToDie) + 1\n        \n        pigs = 0\n        \n        # The number of buckets that can be distinguished with the current number of pigs.\n        # With 0 pigs, we can only handle 1 bucket (by assuming it's the one).\n        testable_buckets = 1\n        \n        # Increment pigs until we can distinguish between all 'buckets'.\n        # This is equivalent to finding the smallest 'pigs' such that\n        # (states_per_pig)^pigs >= buckets.\n        while testable_buckets < buckets:\n            testable_buckets *= states_per_pig\n            pigs += 1\n            \n        return pigs\n\n```\n\n=== DESIGN ===\nAn elegant solution to this problem stems from an information-theoretic perspective.

The minimum number of pigs needed is `2`.\nThis logic directly translates into a simple and efficient algorithm.\n1.  **Algorithm Choice**: A simple iterative approach is used to solve the mathematical inequality `base^p >= buckets`. This avoids the potential precision issues of floating-point logarithmic calculations and is highly efficient given the problem's constraints.\n2.  **Step-by-Step Approach**:\n    1.  Calculate the number of test rounds available: `num_tests = minutesToTest // minutesToDie`.\n    2.  Determine the number of distinct states for a single pig. A pig can die in any of the `num_tests` rounds, or it can survive. This gives `states_per_pig = num_tests + 1`. This value forms the base of our \"information system\".\n    3.  We need to find the smallest integer `p` (pigs) such that `(states_per_pig)^p >= buckets`.\n    4.  Initialize a `pigs` counter to 0.\n    5.  Initialize a `testable_buckets` counter to 1 (representing the single outcome possible with 0 pigs).\n    6.  Use a `while` loop to repeatedly multiply `testable_buckets` by `states_per_pig` and increment `pigs` until `testable_buckets` is greater than or equal to `buckets`.\n    7.  The final value of `pigs` is the minimum number required.\n3.  **Data Structures**: The solution only requires a few integer variables for calculation. No complex data structures are necessary.\n4.  **Time Complexity**: The number of iterations in the `while` loop is the smallest `p` that satisfies `base^p >= buckets`. This is equivalent to `p = ceil(log_base(buckets))`. Therefore, the time complexity is logarithmic with respect to the number of buckets, `O(log(buckets))`.\n5.  **Space Complexity**: The memory usage is constant as it only involves a few variables, regardless of the input size. Thus, the space complexity is `O(1)`.\n6.  **Pseudocode**:\n    ```\n    FUNCTION poorPigs(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest):\n        // Calculate how many states one pig can represent\n        states_per_pig = floor(minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1\n        \n        pigs = 0\n        testable_buckets = 1\n        \n        // Find smallest 'pigs' such that (states_per_pig)^pigs >= buckets\n        WHILE testable_buckets < buckets:\n            testable_buckets = testable_buckets * states_per_pig\n            pigs = pigs + 1\n        ENDWHILE\n        \n        RETURN pigs\n    END FUNCTION\n    ```\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:\n        states_per_pig = (minutesToTest // minutesToDie) + 1\n        \n        pigs = 0\n        testable_buckets = 1\n        \n        while testable_buckets < buckets:\n            testable_buckets *= states_per_pig\n            pigs += 1\n            \n        return pigs\n```\n\n=== IMPLEMENTATION ===\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:\n        states_per_pig = (minutesToTest // minutesToDie) + 1\n        \n        pigs = 0\n        testable_buckets = 1\n        \n        while testable_buckets < buckets:\n            testable_buckets *= states_per_pig\n            pigs += 1\n            \n        return pigs\n```\n\n=== VERIFICATION ===\n```python\nimport math\n\nclass Solution:\n    def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:\n        states_per_pig = (minutesToTest // minutesToDie) + 1\n        \n        pigs = 0\n        testable_buckets = 1\n        \n        while testable_buckets < buckets:\n            testable_buckets *= states_per_pig\n            pigs += 1\n            \n        return pigs\n```\n\n",
