      "Answer": "=== ANALYSIS ===\n```python\nimport collections\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minPatches(self, nums: list[int], n: int) -> int:\n        patches = 0\n        reach = 1\n        i = 0\n        \n        while reach <= n:\n            if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= reach:\n                reach += nums[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                reach += reach\n                patches += 1\n        \n        return patches\n```\n\n=== DESIGN ===\nAn elegant and efficient way to solve this problem is by using a greedy algorithm. The core idea is to keep track of the maximum number that can be formed by the sums of elements from the (patched) array. Let's call this `reach`. Initially, without any numbers, the `reach` is 0. We want to be able to form all numbers from 1 to `n`.\n\nLet's say we can currently form all numbers in the range `[1, k]`. The next number we need to be able to form is `k + 1`. We can use the numbers in the `nums` array or add a patch.\n\nIf the next number in `nums`, say `x`, is less than or equal to `k + 1`, we can use it. By adding `x` to our set of numbers, we can now form all sums we could before, plus `x` added to all of those sums. This extends our range of formable numbers to `[1, k + x]`.\n\nIf the next number in `nums` is greater than `k + 1`, or if we have run out of numbers in `nums`, then we are stuck. We cannot form `k + 1`. We must add a patch. To be most efficient and extend our reach as much as possible, the best number to add is `k + 1` itself. By adding `k + 1` as a patch, our new range of formable numbers becomes `[1, k + (k + 1)] = [1, 2k + 1]`.\n\nWe can maintain a variable, let's call it `miss`, which is the smallest number we cannot yet form. Initially, `miss = 1`. In each step, we try to form `miss`.\n- If there is a number `num` in the array such that `num <= miss`, we can use it. This extends our reach from `[1, miss-1]` to `[1, miss-1 + num]`. The new `miss` becomes `miss + num`.\n- If the next number in the array is greater than `miss` (or we're out of numbers), we must patch. The optimal patch is `miss` itself. This extends our reach from `[1, miss-1]` to `[1, miss-1 + miss] = [1, 2*miss - 1]`. The new `miss` becomes `2 * miss`.\n\nWe repeat this process, greedily extending our reach, until we can form all numbers up to `n`.\n\nNow, let's translate this into a concrete implementation.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minPatches(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> int:\n        patches = 0\n        reach = 1\n        i = 0\n        \n        while reach <= n:\n            if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= reach:\n                reach += nums[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                reach += reach\n                patches += 1\n        \n        return patches\n```\n\n=== IMPLEMENTATION ===\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minPatches(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> int:\n        patches = 0\n        reach = 1\n        i = 0\n        \n        while reach <= n:\n            if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= reach:\n                reach += nums[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                reach += reach\n                patches += 1\n        \n        return patches\n```\n\n=== VERIFICATION ===\nAn elegant and efficient way to solve this problem is by using a greedy algorithm.

The new `miss` becomes `2 * miss`.\nWe repeat this process, greedily extending our reach, until we can form all numbers up to `n`.\nNow, let's translate this into a concrete implementation.\n\n### Verification Report\n\n**1. Correctness**\nThe solution correctly implements the greedy algorithm described in the analysis. It maintains a variable `reach` representing the smallest number that cannot yet be formed. The algorithm iteratively extends the range of formable numbers `[1, reach - 1]` by either using a number from `nums` or adding a patch. The choice at each step is optimal: using `nums[i]` if `nums[i] <= reach`, or patching with `reach` otherwise. This correctly and minimally extends the coverage until the entire range `[1, n]` is formable. The logic is sound.\n\n**2. Edge Cases**\nThe implementation handles edge cases robustly:\n*   **`nums` already covers `[1, n]`**: Correctly returns 0 patches (e.g., `nums = [1,2,2], n = 5`).\n*   **Empty `nums`**: Correctly adds patches `1, 2, 4, ...` to build the range from scratch.\n*   **`nums` does not start with 1**: Correctly patches 1 (if needed) and proceeds.\n*   **Large `n`**: Python's arbitrary-precision integers prevent overflow for the `reach` variable, ensuring correctness for `n` up to `2^31 - 1`.\n\n**3. Complexity**\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(len(nums) + log n). The `while` loop continues as long as `reach <= n`. In each iteration, either `i` is incremented (at most `len(nums)` times) or `reach` is at least doubled (at most `log n` times).\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses a fixed number of variables, making its space usage constant.\n\n**4. Code Quality**\nThe code is clean, readable, and concise. Variable names are appropriate for the algorithm. The structure is a direct and efficient implementation of the greedy strategy. It follows best practices, including the use of type hints.\n\n**5. Test Cases**\nThe solution passes all provided sample test cases:\n*   `nums = [1,3], n = 6` -> `Output: 1`. **Correct**.\n*   `nums = [1,5,10], n = 20` -> `Output: 2`. **Correct**.\n*   `nums = [1,2,2], n = 5` -> `Output: 0`. **Correct**.\n\n**6. Potential Issues**\nNo logical errors or bugs were identified in the provided `Implemented Code`. The solution is correct and complete. There is a minor discrepancy in the problem description's `Analysis` section, which includes an unused `import collections`, but this is absent from the `Implemented Code` and does not affect the solution's validity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided solution is correct, efficient, and of high quality. It is a valid and robust implementation for the given problem.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minPatches(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> int:\n        patches = 0\n        reach = 1\n        i = 0\n        \n        while reach <= n:\n            if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= reach:\n                reach += nums[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                reach += reach\n                patches += 1\n        \n        return patches\n```\n\n",
