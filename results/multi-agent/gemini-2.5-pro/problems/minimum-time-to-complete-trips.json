      "Answer": "=== ANALYSIS ===\nAn elegant and efficient way to solve this problem is by using binary search on the answer. The problem asks for the *minimum time*, and we can observe a key monotonic property: if a certain amount of time `t` is sufficient to complete `totalTrips`, then any time `t' > t` will also be sufficient. This suggests that we can binary search for the smallest `t` that satisfies the condition.\n\n### Algorithm Outline:\n\n1.  **Define a Search Space:**\n    *   The minimum possible time is 1. So, our lower bound (`low`) can be 1.\n    *   A safe upper bound (`high`) can be estimated by considering the worst-case scenario. If only the fastest bus (with time `min(time)`) were to complete all the trips, it would take `min(time) * totalTrips`. This is a guaranteed upper limit for the required time, as having more buses can only help reduce the time.\n\n2.  **Binary Search:**\n    *   We search for the minimum time `t` in the range `[low, high]`.\n    *   In each step, we take the middle time `mid` and check if it's possible to complete at least `totalTrips` within this `mid` time.\n\n3.  **Check Function (`is_sufficient(t)`):**\n    *   For a given time `t`, the number of trips a single bus `i` can complete is `t // time[i]`.\n    *   To check if time `t` is sufficient, we sum the trips completed by all buses: `sum(t // time[i] for i in time)`.\n    *   If this sum is greater than or equal to `totalTrips`, then time `t` is sufficient.\n\n4.  **Narrowing the Search Space:**\n    *   If `mid` time is sufficient, it means `mid` is a potential answer, and the actual minimum time could be `mid` or something smaller. So, we try to find a better answer in the lower half of the search range: `[low, mid]`.\n    *   If `mid` time is not sufficient, we need more time. The answer must lie in the upper half: `[mid + 1, high]`.\n\n5.  **Termination:**\n    *   The binary search continues until the search space `[low, high]` converges to a single value. This value will be the minimum time required.\n\n### Complexity Analysis:\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** `O(N * log(M * K))`, where `N` is the number of buses, `M` is the minimum trip time, and `K` is `totalTrips`. The `log` factor comes from the binary search over the time range, and for each time check, we iterate through all `N` buses.\n*   **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we only use a few variables for the binary search, not dependent on the input size.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumTime(self, time: List[int], totalTrips: int) -> int:\n        low = 1\n        # A safe upper bound is the time it would take for the fastest bus\n        # to complete all trips by itself.\n        high = min(time) * totalTrips\n\n        # Binary search for the minimum time. The key property is that if time 't'\n        # is sufficient, any time greater than 't' is also sufficient.
