This approach systematically builds up the solution by solving smaller, overlapping subproblems. Below is a detailed design of this solution.\n\n### 1. Algorithm Choice\n**Dynamic Programming (DP)** is the chosen algorithm. This problem exhibits optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, making it a classic candidate for DP. We will use a bottom-up tabulation method to build the solution.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Approach\nThe core idea is to build a 2D table, let's call it `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum edit distance required to convert the first `i` characters of `word1` into the first `j` characters of `word2`.\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Create a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`, where `m` is the length of `word1` and `n` is the length of `word2`.\n    *   **Base Case 1**: The first row `dp[0][j]` represents converting an empty string to the first `j` characters of `word2`. This can only be done by `j` insertions. So, set `dp[0][j] = j` for `j` from `0` to `n`.\n    *   **Base Case 2**: The first column `dp[i][0]` represents converting the first `i` characters of `word1` to an empty string. This requires `i` deletions. So, set `dp[i][0] = i` for `i` from `0` to `m`.\n\n2.  **DP Calculation (Iteration)**:\n    *   Iterate through the `dp` table from `i = 1` to `m` and `j = 1` to `n`.\n    *   For each cell `dp[i][j]`, we consider the characters `word1[i-1]` and `word2[j-1]`.\n    *   **Case A: Characters Match** (`word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]`):\n        *   If the last characters of the current substrings are the same, no operation is needed for them. The cost is simply the cost of converting the prefixes, which is `dp[i-1][j-1]`. So, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.\n    *   **Case B: Characters Differ** (`word1[i-1] != word2[j-1]`):\n        *   If the characters are different, we must perform one operation. We choose the operation that results in the minimum total cost:\n            1.  **Deletion**: Delete `word1[i-1]` and transform `word1`'s prefix of length `i-1` to `word2`'s prefix of length `j`. Cost: `1 + dp[i-1][j]`.\n            2.  **Insertion**: Transform `word1`'s prefix of length `i` to `word2`'s prefix of length `j-1` and then insert `word2[j-1]`. Cost: `1 + dp[i][j-1]`.\n            3.  **Substitution**: Replace `word1[i-1]` with `word2[j-1]` and transform the prefixes. Cost: `1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`.\n        *   We take the minimum of these three possibilities: `dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])`.\n\n3.  **Result**:\n    *   After filling the entire table, the value at `dp[m][n]` will contain the minimum edit distance for the complete `word1` and `word2`. Return this value.\n\n### 3. Data Structures\n*   A **2D array** (or a list of lists in Python) of size `(len(word1) + 1) x (len(word2) + 1)` to store the intermediate DP results.\n\n### 4. Time Complexity\n*   **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the length of `word1` and `n` is the length of `word2`. This is because we iterate through each cell of the `m x n` DP table once, and the computation for each cell takes constant time.\n\n### 5. Space Complexity\n*   **O(m * n)**. The space is dominated by the `(m+1) x (n+1)` DP table used for memoization.\n\n### 6. Pseudocode\n```\nFUNCTION minDistance(word1, word2):\n    m = length of word1\n    n = length of word2\n\n    // Create a DP table of size (m+1) x (n+1)\n    dp = new 2D array of size (m+1) x (n+1)\n\n    // Initialize the first column (deletions to get an empty string)\n    FOR i FROM 0 TO m:\n        dp[i][0] = i\n    \n    // Initialize the first row (insertions from an empty string)\n    FOR j FROM 0 TO n:\n        dp[0][j] = j\n\n    // Fill the rest of the DP table\n    FOR i FROM 1 TO m:\n        FOR j FROM 1 TO n:\n            // If the last characters match, no operation is needed\n            IF word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n            ELSE:\n                // If they don't match, find the minimum cost of the 3 operations\n                cost_delete = dp[i-1][j]\n                cost_insert = dp[i][j-1]\n                cost_replace = dp[i-1][j-1]\n                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(cost_delete, cost_insert, cost_replace)\n\n    // The result is in the bottom-right corner of the table\n    RETURN dp[m][n]\n```\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:\n        m = len(word1)\n        n = len(word2)\n\n        # dp[i][j] will be the minimum cost to convert word1[:i] to word2[:j]\n        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n\n        # Initialize the base cases for the DP table.\n        # Cost to convert a string of length i to an empty string is i deletions.\n        for i in range(m + 1):\n            dp[i][0] = i\n        \n        # Cost to convert an empty string to a string of length j is j insertions.\n        for j in range(n + 1):\n            dp[0][j] = j\n        \n        # Fill the rest of the DP table\n        for i in range(1, m + 1):\n            for j in range(1, n + 1):\n                # The characters are at indices i-1 and j-1\n                if word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]:\n                    # If characters are the same, no operation is needed.\n                    # The cost is the same as the cost for the prefixes.\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n                else:\n                    # If characters are different, we consider three operations:\n                    # 1.

This requires `i` deletions. So, set `dp[i][0] = i` for `i` from `0` to `m`.\n2.  **DP Calculation (Iteration)**:\n    *   Iterate through the `dp` table from `i = 1` to `m` and `j = 1` to `n`.\n    *   For each cell `dp[i][j]`, we consider the characters `word1[i-1]` and `word2[j-1]`.\n    *   **Case A: Characters Match** (`word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]`):\n        *   If the last characters of the current substrings are the same, no operation is needed for them. The cost is simply the cost of converting the prefixes, which is `dp[i-1][j-1]`. So, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.\n    *   **Case B: Characters Differ** (`word1[i-1] != word2[j-1]`):\n        *   If the characters are different, we must perform one operation. We choose the operation that results in the minimum total cost:\n            1.  **Deletion**: Delete `word1[i-1]` and transform `word1`'s prefix of length `i-1` to `word2`'s prefix of length `j`. Cost: `1 + dp[i-1][j]`.\n            2.  **Insertion**: Transform `word1`'s prefix of length `i` to `word2`'s prefix of length `j-1` and then insert `word2[j-1]`. Cost: `1 + dp[i][j-1]`.\n            3.  **Substitution**: Replace `word1[i-1]` with `word2[j-1]` and transform the prefixes. Cost: `1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`.\n        *   We take the minimum of these three possibilities: `dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])`.\n3.  **Result**:\n    *   After filling the entire table, the value at `dp[m][n]` will contain the minimum edit distance for the complete `word1` and `word2`. Return this value.\n### 3. Data Structures\n*   A **2D array** (or a list of lists in Python) of size `(len(word1) + 1) x (len(word2) + 1)` to store the intermediate DP results.\n### 4. Time Complexity\n*   **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the length of `word1` and `n` is the length of `word2`. This is because we iterate through each cell of the `m x n` DP table once, and the computation for each cell takes constant time.\n### 5. Space Complexity\n*   **O(m * n)**. The space is dominated by the `(m+1) x (n+1)` DP table used for memoization.\n### 6.
