      "Answer": "=== ANALYSIS ===\nAn elegant and efficient way to solve this problem is by modeling it as a graph problem and finding its connected components. The total number of swaps required is `N - C`, where `N` is the number of couples and `C` is the number of connected components.\n\nLet's define the nodes of our graph to be the `n` couples, indexed from `0` to `n-1`. A person with ID `p` belongs to couple `p // 2`.\n\nWe can iterate through the `n` pairs of adjacent seats. For each seat pair `(2i, 2i+1)`, if the two people sitting there, `row[2i]` and `row[2i+1]`, do not belong to the same couple, it means their respective couples are \"entangled\". For instance, if `row[2i]` belongs to couple `C1` and `row[2i+1]` to `C2`, this entanglement can be represented as an edge between nodes `C1` and `C2` in our graph.\n\nAfter processing all seat pairs, the graph will consist of one or more connected components. A component of size `k` signifies a group of `k` couples that are intermingled among `k` seat pairs. To untangle such a group, `k-1` swaps are necessary. For example, if couple A and B are mixed (_e.g._, `(A1, B1)` and `(A2, B2)`), one swap brings them to `(A1, A2)` and `(B1, B2)`.\n\nThe total number of swaps is the sum of `(k - 1)` for each component of size `k`. This simplifies to `(sum of all k_i) - (number of components)`, which is `n - C`, where `C` is the number of components.\n\nThe Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure is perfectly suited for building these components and counting them efficiently. We initialize `n` sets, one for each couple. Then, for each seat pair, we `union` the sets of the two couples present. The DSU structure keeps track of the number of distinct sets, which is our `C`.\n\nThe final algorithm is:\n1. Initialize a DSU structure with `n` sets.\n2. Iterate through the `row` array in steps of 2. For each pair of people `(row[i], row[i+1])`, find their couple IDs, `c1 = row[i] // 2` and `c2 = row[i+1] // 2`.\n3. Perform a `union` operation on `c1` and `c2`.\n4. The DSU will maintain the count of disjoint sets (`C`).\n5. The minimum number of swaps is `n - C`.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of nearly `O(n)` due to the efficiency of the DSU with path compression.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minSwapsCouples(self, row: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(row) // 2\n        \n        parent = list(range(n))\n        num_components = n\n\n        def find(i: int) -> int:\n            if parent[i] == i:\n                return i\n            parent[i] = find(parent[i])\n            return parent[i]\n\n        def union(i: int, j: int) -> None:\n            nonlocal num_components\n            root_i = find(i)\n            root_j = find(j)\n            if root_i != root_j:\n                parent[root_j] = root_i\n                num_components -= 1\n\n        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):\n            person1 = row[i]\n            person2 = row[i + 1]\n            \n            couple1 = person1 // 2\n            couple2 = person2 // 2\n            \n            union(couple1, couple2)\n            \n        return n - num_components\n\n```\n\n=== DESIGN ===\nTo solve this problem, I will implement the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) based approach as detailed in the provided analysis. This method models the problem by treating each of the `n` couples as a node in a graph. An edge is formed between two couple-nodes if their members are mixed up in the same pair of adjacent seats. The total number of swaps required is `n - C`, where `n` is the number of couples and `C` is the number of connected components (groups of entangled couples).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the design:\n\n1.  **Algorithm Choice**: The Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find algorithm will be used. This data structure excels at tracking a partition of a set into disjoint subsets, which directly corresponds to finding the connected components in our graph of couples.\n\n2.  **Step-by-Step Approach**:\n    1.  Calculate `n`, the number of couples, as `len(row) // 2`.\n    2.  Initialize a DSU structure for `n` elements (couples `0` to `n-1`). This involves creating a `parent` array and setting a `num_components` counter to `n`.\n    3.  Iterate through the `row` array in steps of two, processing each adjacent seat pair `(i, i+1)`.\n    4.  For each pair, identify the two people `row[i]` and `row[i+1]`.\n    5.  Calculate their respective couple IDs using integer division by 2 (e.g., `couple_id = person_id // 2`).\n    6.  Use the `union` operation of the DSU to merge the sets of the two couples found in the current seat pair. The `union` operation will only merge and decrement the component count if the two couples are not already in the same component.\n    7.  After iterating through all seat pairs, the final `num_components` count represents `C`.\n    8.  The minimum number of swaps is `n - num_components`.\n\n3.  **Data Structures**:\n    *   A `parent` list of size `n` for the DSU, where `parent[i]` stores the parent of the `i`-th couple's set.\n    *   An integer variable `num_components` to track the number of disjoint sets.\n\n4.  **Time Complexity**: The DSU initialization takes `O(n)`. The main loop runs `n` times. Inside the loop, `find` and `union` operations with path compression have an amortized time complexity that is nearly constant. Thus, the total time complexity is effectively linear, `O(n)`.\n\n5.  **Space Complexity**: The `parent` array requires `O(n)` space. Thus, the space complexity is `O(n)`.\n\n6.  **Pseudocode**:\n    ```\n    function minSwapsCouples(row):\n      n = length(row) / 2\n      parent = array of size n, initialized with parent[i] = i\n      num_components = n\n\n      function find(i):\n        if parent[i] == i:\n          return i\n        parent[i] = find(parent[i]) // Path compression\n        return parent[i]\n\n      function union(i, j):\n        root_i = find(i)\n        root_j = find(j)\n        if root_i != root_j:\n          parent[root_j] = root_i\n          num_components = num_components - 1\n      \n      for i from 0 to length(row)-1, step 2:\n        couple1_id = row[i] / 2\n        couple2_id = row[i+1] / 2\n        union(couple1_id, couple2_id)\n\n      return n - num_components\n    ```\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minSwapsCouples(self, row: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(row) // 2\n        \n        parent = list(range(n))\n        num_components = n\n\n        def find(i: int) -> int:\n            if parent[i] == i:\n                return i\n            parent[i] = find(parent[i])\n            return parent[i]\n\n        def union(i: int, j: int) -> None:\n            nonlocal num_components\n            root_i = find(i)\n            root_j = find(j)\n            \n            if root_i != root_j:\n                parent[root_j] = root_i\n                num_components -= 1\n\n        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):\n            person1 = row[i]\n            person2 = row[i + 1]\n            \n            couple1 = person1 // 2\n            couple2 = person2 // 2\n            \n            if couple1 != couple2:\n                union(couple1, couple2)\n            \n        return n - num_components\n```\n\n=== IMPLEMENTATION ===\n```python\nimport collections\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minSwapsCouples(self, row: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(row) // 2\n        \n        parent = list(range(n))\n        num_components = n\n\n        def find(i: int) -> int:\n            if parent[i] == i:\n                return i\n            parent[i] = find(parent[i])\n            return parent[i]\n\n        def union(i: int, j: int) -> None:\n            nonlocal num_components\n            root_i = find(i)\n            root_j = find(j)\n            \n            if root_i != root_j:\n                parent[root_j] = root_i\n                num_components -= 1\n\n        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):\n            person1 = row[i]\n            person2 = row[i + 1]\n            \n            couple1 = person1 // 2\n            couple2 = person2 // 2\n            \n            union(couple1, couple2)\n            \n        return n - num_components\n```\n\n=== VERIFICATION ===\n**Verification Report**\n\n1.  **Correctness**: The provided solution is correct. It accurately implements the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) algorithm to solve the problem. The core idea that the minimum number of swaps is `n - C` (where `n` is the number of couples and `C` is the number of connected components of \"entangled\" couples) is sound. The code correctly maps each seat pair to a potential connection between two couple-groups and uses `union` to build these components.\n\n2.  **Edge Cases**: The algorithm correctly handles edge cases. If all couples are already seated correctly, each seat pair `(2i, 2i+1)` will contain people from the same couple. The `union` operation will be called with two identical couple IDs, `union(c, c)`, which correctly does not merge any sets. The number of components `C` will remain `n`, leading to `n - n = 0` swaps, which is correct. The constraints (`n` up to 30) are well within the limits for this efficient algorithm.\n\n3.  **Complexity**:\n    *   **Time Complexity**: `O(n * \u03b1(n))`, where `n` is the number of couples and `\u03b1` is the extremely slow-growing inverse Ackermann function. Due to path compression, the `find` and `union` operations are nearly constant time. The overall complexity is effectively linear, `O(n)`, which is highly efficient.\n    *   **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` to store the `parent` array for the DSU structure. This is also efficient.\n\n4.  **Code Quality**: The code is clean, readable, and well-structured. It uses nested functions (`find`, `union`) to encapsulate the DSU logic, which is a good practice for single-use helper functions. Variable names are clear and self-explanatory. The `nonlocal` keyword is used correctly. The implementation of path compression in the `find` function is standard and correct.\n    *   The provided \"Implemented Code\" includes `import collections`, which is not used and should be removed. Otherwise, the code quality is high.\n\n5.  **Test Cases**:\n    *   **Example 1**: `row = [0,2,1,3]`. `n=2`. The first seat pair `(0,2)` links couple 0 and couple 1. `num_components` becomes 1. The second seat pair `(1,3)` also involves couple 0 and 1, which are already linked. The final result is `n - num_components` = `2 - 1 = 1`. This is correct.\n    *   **Example 2**: `row = [3,2,0,1]`. `n=2`. The first pair `(3,2)` belongs to couple 1. The second pair `(0,1)` belongs to couple 0. No links are formed between different couples. `num_components` remains 2. The final result is `n - num_components` = `2 - 2 = 0`. This is correct.\n\n6.  **Potential Issues / Improvements**: There are no bugs or logical errors in the proposed solution. The code is robust. The check `if couple1 != couple2:` present in one of the snippets is redundant, as the `union` function's `if root_i != root_j:` check already handles this case effectively. The version without this explicit check is slightly more concise. The unused `import collections` is the only minor flaw.\n\n**Conclusion**: The solution is valid, correct, and follows best practices. The DSU-based approach is an elegant and efficient way to solve this problem.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minSwapsCouples(self, row: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(row) // 2\n        \n        parent = list(range(n))\n        num_components = n\n\n        def find(i: int) -> int:\n            if parent[i] == i:\n                return i\n            parent[i] = find(parent[i])\n            return parent[i]\n\n        def union(i: int, j: int) -> None:\n            nonlocal num_components\n            root_i = find(i)\n            root_j = find(j)\n            \n            if root_i != root_j:\n                parent[root_j] = root_i\n                num_components -= 1\n        \n        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):\n            couple1_id = row[i] // 2\n            couple2_id = row[i + 1] // 2\n            union(couple1_id, couple2_id)\n            \n        return n - num_components\n```\n\n",
