      "Answer": "=== ANALYSIS ===\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at each position `i`. A naive dynamic programming approach would be to compute `ans[i]` by iterating through all `j < i`, which results in an `O(n^2)` time complexity, too slow for the given constraints.\n\nThis problem is a variation of the classic Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem, which can be optimized to `O(n log n)`. The key is to maintain an auxiliary list, let's call it `lis`, that stores the smallest tail of all non-decreasing subsequences of a given length. This `lis` list will always be sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nFor each obstacle `obs` at index `i`, we want to find the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence in `obstacles[0...i-1]` that can be extended by `obs`. This means the subsequence must end with a value less than or equal to `obs`. The length of this longest \"prefix\" subsequence can be found efficiently by performing a binary search on our `lis` array.\n\nThe `bisect_right` function from Python's `bisect` module is perfect for this. `bisect.bisect_right(lis, obs)` returns an insertion index `k` which is equal to the number of elements in `lis` that are less than or equal to `obs`. This `k` is the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence we can prepend to `obs`.\n\nTherefore, the length of the longest obstacle course ending at the current position is `k + 1`. We store this value in our result array.\n\nAfter finding the length, we must update the `lis` array to account for the new subsequence we've just formed. The current obstacle `obs` can form the end of a non-decreasing subsequence of length `k + 1`.\n- If `k` is equal to the current length of `lis`, it means `obs` is greater than or equal to all existing tails. This allows us to form a new, longer subsequence. We append `obs` to `lis`.\n- If `k` is less than the length of `lis`, it means there's already a subsequence of length `k + 1` with a tail of `lis[k]`. Since `bisect_right` ensures `obs < lis[k]`, `obs` is a smaller and thus \"better\" tail for a subsequence of this length. A smaller tail allows more possibilities for future extensions. So, we update `lis[k]` with `obs`.\n\nBy iterating through all obstacles and applying this logic, we can build the answer array in `O(n log n)` time.\n\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(self, obstacles: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # lis[k] stores the smallest tail of a non-decreasing subsequence of length k+1.\n        # This list is always kept sorted.\n        lis = []\n        ans = []\n\n        for obs in obstacles:\n            # Find the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending before\n            # the current position that can be extended by `obs`.
