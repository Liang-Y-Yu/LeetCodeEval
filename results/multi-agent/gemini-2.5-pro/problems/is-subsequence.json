      "Answer": "=== ANALYSIS ===\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:\n        s_ptr = 0\n        t_ptr = 0\n        \n        while s_ptr < len(s) and t_ptr < len(t):\n            # If characters match, advance the pointer for s\n            if s[s_ptr] == t[t_ptr]:\n                s_ptr += 1\n            # Always advance the pointer for t to scan through it\n            t_ptr += 1\n            \n        # If s_ptr has reached the end of s, all characters were found in order\n        return s_ptr == len(s)\n\n```\n\n=== DESIGN ===\nAn elegant and efficient way to solve this problem is by using a two-pointer greedy approach. This method avoids the need for more complex data structures or recursion, offering a linear time complexity solution.\n\n### 1. Algorithm Choice\nThe chosen algorithm is the **Two-Pointer Greedy Approach**. This is suitable because we only need to scan through the strings once to determine if `s` is a subsequence of `t`. The greedy nature of the algorithm lies in matching the characters of `s` as early as possible in `t`.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Approach\n1.  Initialize two pointers, `s_ptr` for string `s` and `t_ptr` for string `t`, both starting at index 0.\n2.  Iterate with a `while` loop as long as both pointers are within the bounds of their respective strings.\n3.  Inside the loop, compare the character `s[s_ptr]` with `t[t_ptr]`.\n4.  If the characters match, it means we've found the current character of `s` in `t`. We then advance `s_ptr` to look for the next character in `s`.\n5.  The pointer `t_ptr` is always advanced in each iteration to scan through string `t`.\n6.  The loop terminates when either all characters of `s` have been found (`s_ptr` reaches the end of `s`) or when `t` has been fully scanned (`t_ptr` reaches the end of `t`).\n7.  After the loop, if `s_ptr` is equal to the length of `s`, it signifies that every character of `s` was found in `t` in the correct order. In this case, `s` is a subsequence, and we return `true`. Otherwise, we return `false`.\n\n### 3. Data Structures\n- **Input Strings**: `s` and `t`.\n- **Pointers**: Two integer variables to serve as pointers (`s_ptr`, `t_ptr`). No other auxiliary data structures are required.\n\n### 4. Time Complexity\nThe algorithm involves a single pass through the strings. The `t_ptr` traverses `t` at most once. Therefore, the time complexity is **O(len(t))**.\n\n### 5. Space Complexity\nThe solution uses only a fixed number of variables (the two pointers) regardless of the input size. Thus, the space complexity is **O(1)**.\n\n### 6. Pseudocode\n```pseudocode\nFUNCTION isSubsequence(s, t):\n  s_ptr = 0\n  t_ptr = 0\n  \n  WHILE s_ptr < length(s) AND t_ptr < length(t):\n    IF s[s_ptr] == t[t_ptr]:\n      s_ptr = s_ptr + 1\n    t_ptr = t_ptr + 1\n    \n  RETURN s_ptr == length(s)\n```\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:\n        s_ptr = 0\n        t_ptr = 0\n        \n        while s_ptr < len(s) and t_ptr < len(t):\n            if s[s_ptr] == t[t_ptr]:\n                s_ptr += 1\n            t_ptr += 1\n            \n        return s_ptr == len(s)\n\n```\n\n=== IMPLEMENTATION ===\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:\n        s_ptr = 0\n        t_ptr = 0\n        \n        while s_ptr < len(s) and t_ptr < len(t):\n            if s[s_ptr] == t[t_ptr]:\n                s_ptr += 1\n            t_ptr += 1\n            \n        return s_ptr == len(s)\n```\n\n=== VERIFICATION ===\nAn elegant and efficient way to solve this problem is by using a two-pointer greedy approach.

Correctness:**\nThe implemented solution is **correct**. It correctly employs a two-pointer greedy algorithm to determine if `s` is a subsequence of `t`. The logic is sound: it iterates through both strings, advancing the pointer for `s` only when a character match is found. If the `s` pointer traverses the entirety of `s`, it confirms that `s` is a subsequence.\n\n**2. Edge Cases:**\nThe solution correctly handles all relevant edge cases:\n*   **Empty `s` string (`s = \"\"`):** Correctly returns `true`, as an empty string is a subsequence of any string.\n*   **Empty `t` string (`t = \"\"`):** Correctly returns `false` if `s` is not empty.\n*   **`s` and `t` are identical:** Correctly returns `true`.\n*   **`s` is longer than `t`:** Correctly returns `false`.\n\n**3. Complexity:**\nThe complexity analysis provided in the design is accurate.\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(len(t)). The algorithm performs a single pass through the string `t`.\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses a constant amount of extra space for the two pointers, regardless of the input strings' lengths.\n\n**4. Code Quality:**\n*   **Readability:** The code is clean, well-structured, and easy to understand. Variable names (`s_ptr`, `t_ptr`) are descriptive and unambiguous.\n*   **Best Practices:** The implementation follows standard coding practices and is an efficient and straightforward solution to the problem.\n\n**5. Test Cases:**\nThe code passes the provided sample test cases:\n*   **`s = \"abc\"`, `t = \"ahbgdc\"`:** The code will correctly return `true`.\n*   **`s = \"axc\"`, `t = \"ahbgdc\"`:** The code will correctly return `false`.\n\n**6. Potential Issues & Improvements (Follow-up):**\nThe provided solution is optimal for a single `s` and `t`. However, it does not address the follow-up question in the problem statement regarding a large number of incoming `s` strings.\n\n*   **Issue:** For a large number of queries (k >= 10^9), the current solution's total time complexity of O(k * len(t)) would be too slow.\n*   **Suggested Improvement for Follow-up:** To optimize for multiple queries, one should preprocess string `t` to build an index of character positions.\n    1.  **Preprocessing (O(len(t))):** Create a hash map where keys are characters and values are sorted lists of their indices in `t`.\n    2.  **Querying (O(len(s) * log(len(t)))):** For each character in a given `s`, use binary search on the appropriate index list to find the next valid position in `t`.\n\nThis preprocessing approach amortizes the cost of scanning `t` over many queries, leading to a much more efficient overall solution for the follow-up scenario with a total time complexity of O(len(t) + k * len(s) * log(len(t))).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe provided code is a **correct, high-quality, and efficient** solution for the base problem statement. It successfully passes all checks for correctness, edge cases, complexity, and code quality.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:\n        \"\"\"\n        Determines if s is a subsequence of t using a two-pointer approach.\n        \"\"\"\n        s_ptr = 0\n        t_ptr = 0\n        \n        # Iterate while both pointers are within the bounds of their respective strings.\n        while s_ptr < len(s) and t_ptr < len(t):\n            # If the characters at the current pointers match, it means we have found\n            # the current character of s in t.
