You will be given:\n* A problem statement (with sample test cases if available).\n* A starter code snippet (with fixed function signatures).\n\nPlease write your solution in the python3 programming language. Your code must:\n* Solve the problem fully and correctly.\n* Pass all provided sample test cases.\n* Run within acceptable time and memory limits (assume large inputs if none are specified).\n* Follow good coding practices (clear logic, readable structure, appropriate use of language features).\n\nHere is the problem statement: There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.\nArrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot.
