Here is the code as implemented:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nclass Solution:\n    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n        visited = set()\n        stack = [0]\n        \n        while stack:\n            room = stack.pop()\n            if room not in visited:\n                visited.add(room)\n                for key in rooms[room]:\n                    if key not in visited:\n                        stack.append(key)\n        \n        return len(visited) == len(rooms)\n```\n\n","TypedCode":"\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n        visited = set()\n        stack = [0]\n        \n        while stack:\n            room = stack.pop()\n            if room not in visited:\n                visited.add(room)\n                for key in rooms[room]:\n                    if key not in visited:\n                        stack.append(key)\n        \n        return len(visited) == len(rooms)\n","Model":"se-gpt-4o","Latency":8324371774,"SolvedAt":"2025-09-05T23:47:07.624258705+02:00","PromptTokens":3569,"OutputTokens":908}},"Submissions":{"se-gpt-4o":{"SubmitRequest":{"lang":"python3","question_id":"871","typed_code":"\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n        visited = set()\n        stack = [0]\n        \n        while stack:\n            room = stack.pop()\n            if room not in visited:\n                visited.add(room)\n                for key in rooms[room]:\n                    if key not in visited:\n                        stack.append(key)\n        \n        return len(visited) == len(rooms)\n"},"SubmissionId":1760933384,"CheckResponse":{"status_code":10,"status_msg":"Accepted","Finished":true,"State":"SUCCESS"},"SubmittedAt":"2025-09-06T00:11:43.496121037+02:00"}}}
