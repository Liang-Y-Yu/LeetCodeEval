Let's review the solution based on the points outlined:\n\n1. **Correctness**:  \n   The code correctly employs the greedy strategy of sorting balloons by their end positions and iteratively determining if a new arrow is needed when a balloon's start surpasses the current end being tracked. This is an efficient approach for the problem, ensuring that overlapping balloons are burst with a minimal number of arrows.\n\n2. **Edge Cases**:  \n   The solution correctly handles various edge cases:\n   - If the `points` list is empty, the function will correctly return 0 as no balloons exist.\n   - For balloons with overlapping intervals, the algorithm handles these correctly by grouping and bursting them using the minimum necessary arrows.\n   - Given the constraints, the solution handles the maximum possible input size efficiently.\n\n3. **Complexity**:  \n   The time complexity of the solution is dominated by the sorting step, which is \\(O(n \\log n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of balloons (elements in `points`). The subsequent iteration through the sorted list takes \\(O(n)\\). Thus, this is optimal for the problem requirements and handles large input sizes effectively. Space complexity is \\(O(\\text{sort})\\) or \\(O(1)\\) extra space aside for any additional data structures.\n\n4. **Code Quality**:  \n   The solution is clean and follows best practices. It uses meaningful variable names (`arrows`, `current_end`) and a lambda function for sorting. The logic is straightforward and easy to understand, adhering to Python conventions.\n\n5. **Test Cases**:  \n   The provided examples:\n   - Example 1: Correctly requires 2 arrows.\n   - Example 2: Correctly requires 4 arrows (all balloons are separate).\n   - Example 3: Correctly requires 2 arrows due to overlaps.\n   The solution provides correct outputs for these test cases.\n\n6. **Potential Issues**:  \n   There are no apparent issues or logical errors in the implementation. The algorithm utilizes the optimal approach for the given problem constraints and covers edge cases effectively.\n\nThus, the implemented solution is correct, handles all identified edge cases, maintains optimal performance, and follows good coding practices.\n\nHere's the confirmed code:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        arrows = 0\n        current_end = float('-inf')\n        for xstart, xend in points:\n            if xstart > current_end:\n                arrows += 1\n                current_end = xend\n        return arrows\n```\n\n","TypedCode":"\nclass Solution:\n    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        arrows = 0\n        current_end = float('-inf')\n        for xstart, xend in points:\n            if xstart > current_end:\n                arrows += 1\n                current_end = xend\n        return arrows\n","Model":"se-gpt-4o","Latency":8511670522,"SolvedAt":"2025-09-05T23:50:51.985711283+02:00","PromptTokens":4261,"OutputTokens":1035}},"Submissions":{"se-gpt-4o":{"SubmitRequest":{"lang":"python3","question_id":"452","typed_code":"\nclass Solution:\n    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        arrows = 0\n        current_end = float('-inf')\n        for xstart, xend in points:\n            if xstart > current_end:\n                arrows += 1\n                current_end = xend\n        return arrows\n"},"SubmissionId":1760936111,"CheckResponse":{"status_code":10,"status_msg":"Accepted","Finished":true,"State":"SUCCESS"},"SubmittedAt":"2025-09-06T00:19:07.199825077+02:00"}}}
