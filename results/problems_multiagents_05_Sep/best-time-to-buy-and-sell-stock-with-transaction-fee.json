Let's review it against the checklist:\n\n1. **Correctness**: \n   - The algorithm captures the two states, `cash` and `hold`, effectively to ensure maximum profit calculation: \n     - `cash` reflects the maximum amount when not holding any stock.\n     - `hold` reflects the maximum amount when holding a stock.\n   - At each step, it updates these states based on previous states and current stock price, following the designed plan:\n     - For `cash`, it checks the maximum between maintaining previous cash and selling the current held stock minus fee.\n     - For `hold`, it checks the maximum between maintaining the previous hold state and buying current stock.\n   - The final return of `cash` is correct since it represents the maximum profit without holding any stock.\n\n2. **Edge Cases**: \n   - It correctly handles minimum length of `prices` array (1 or 0), producing a profit of 0 since no transactions can be completed.\n   - No negative or unrealistic prices are expected given constraints, simplifying boundary conditions.\n\n3. **Complexity**: \n   - Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of `prices`, as it makes a single pass through the list.\n   - Space Complexity: O(1), since it uses only a constant amount of space, `cash` and `hold`.\n\n4. **Code Quality**: \n   - The code is clean, concise, and uses meaningful variable names, adhering to PEP 8 standards.\n   - It leverages Pythonâ€™s built-in `max` function for clarity.\n   - Loops and conditional updates are directly reflecting the problem logic.\n\n5. **Test Cases**: \n   - Both example test cases are correctly handled:\n     - For `[1,3,2,8,4,9]`, fee `= 2`, the calculated profit `= 8`.\n     - For `[1,3,7,5,10,3]`, fee `= 3`, the calculated profit `= 6`.\n   - If more edge cases, like a single-day prices input or identical price every day, were tested, the solution would hold.\n\n6. **Potential Issues**: \n   - There are no logical errors or bugs noted in the code. It is efficient and well-structured.\n\nUpon reviewing, the solution is indeed correct. Given these considerations, here is the final solution code:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:\n        cash = 0\n        hold = -prices[0]\n        \n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            cash = max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee)\n            hold = max(hold, cash - prices[i])\n        \n        return cash\n```\n\n","TypedCode":"\nclass Solution:\n    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:\n        cash = 0\n        hold = -prices[0]\n        \n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            cash = max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee)\n            hold = max(hold, cash - prices[i])\n        \n        return cash\n","Model":"se-gpt-4o","Latency":8992128691,"SolvedAt":"2025-09-05T23:41:31.671822811+02:00","PromptTokens":3636,"OutputTokens":1020}},"Submissions":{"se-gpt-4o":{"SubmitRequest":{"lang":"python3","question_id":"714","typed_code":"\nclass Solution:\n    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:\n        cash = 0\n        hold = -prices[0]\n        \n        for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n            cash = max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee)\n            hold = max(hold, cash - prices[i])\n        \n        return cash\n"},"SubmissionId":1760928998,"CheckResponse":{"status_code":10,"status_msg":"Accepted","Finished":true,"State":"SUCCESS"},"SubmittedAt":"2025-09-06T00:00:15.577070038+02:00"}}}
