The code correctly implements the sliding window algorithm to find the minimum window substring containing all characters of `t` within `s`.\n   - It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to dynamically maintain the window and ensures that the substring contains all characters of `t`.\n\n2. **Edge Cases**: \n   - The code adequately handles edge cases:\n     - When either `s` or `t` is empty, it returns an empty string.\n     - If `t` contains characters in greater frequency than in `s`, it returns an empty string. Example provided: `s = \"a\", t = \"aa\"` correctly results in an empty substring.\n     \n3. **Complexity**: \n   - The expected time complexity is O(m + n), where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`. The code operates within this complexity by incrementing and decrementing counters with linear scans enabled by the two-pointer technique.\n   - Space complexity is mainly determined by the number of unique characters in `t` being tracked. This is optimal given the constraints.\n\n4. **Code Quality**: \n   - The code is well-structured, readable, and follows best practices with clear variable names and consistent logic.\n   - Proper use of Python's `collections.Counter` simplifies frequency count management.\n\n5. **Test Cases**: \n   - The solution passes all provided test cases:\n     - `s = \"ADOBECODEBANC\", t = \"ABC\"` produces `BANC`, as expected.\n     - `s = \"a\", t = \"a\"` returns `a`.\n     - `s = \"a\", t = \"aa\"` returns an empty string.\n\n6. **Potential Issues**: \n   - No logical errors or bugs found in the solution.\n   - The code handles special characters and varied cases, given the assumption of the problem constraints (uppercase and lowercase letters).\n\nConclusion: The solution is correct, efficient, and meets the problem's requirements regarding complexity and robustness. It can be executed as-is without further improvements or fixes.\n\nFinal Solution Code:\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n        if not s or not t:\n            return \"\"\n        \n        target_count = Counter(t)\n        required = len(target_count)\n        formed = 0\n        window_count = {}\n        \n        l, r = 0, 0\n        ans = float(\"inf\"), None, None\n        \n        while r < len(s):\n            character = s[r]\n            window_count[character] = window_count.get(character, 0) + 1\n            \n            if character in target_count and window_count[character] == target_count[character]:\n                formed += 1\n            \n            while l <= r and formed == required:\n                character = s[l]\n                \n                if r - l + 1 < ans[0]:\n                    ans = (r - l + 1, l, r)\n                \n                window_count[character] -= 1\n                if character in target_count and window_count[character] < target_count[character]:\n                    formed -= 1\n                \n                l += 1\n            \n            r += 1\n        \n        return \"\" if ans[1] is None else s[ans[1]: ans[2] + 1]\n```\n\n","TypedCode":"\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n        if not s or not t:\n            return \"\"\n        \n        target_count = Counter(t)\n        required = len(target_count)\n        formed = 0\n        window_count = {}\n        \n        l, r = 0, 0\n        ans = float(\"inf\"), None, None\n        \n        while r < len(s):\n            character = s[r]\n            window_count[character] = window_count.get(character, 0) + 1\n            \n            if character in target_count and window_count[character] == target_count[character]:\n                formed += 1\n            \n            while l <= r and formed == required:\n                character = s[l]\n                \n                if r - l + 1 < ans[0]:\n                    ans = (r - l + 1, l, r)\n                \n                window_count[character] -= 1\n                if character in target_count and window_count[character] < target_count[character]:\n                    formed -= 1\n                \n                l += 1\n            \n            r += 1\n        \n        return \"\" if ans[1] is None else s[ans[1]: ans[2] + 1]\n","Model":"se-gpt-4o","Latency":14048543944,"SolvedAt":"2025-09-05T23:51:16.092615818+02:00","PromptTokens":4797,"OutputTokens":1790}},"Submissions":{"se-gpt-4o":{"SubmitRequest":{"lang":"python3","question_id":"76","typed_code":"\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n        if not s or not t:\n            return \"\"\n        \n        target_count = Counter(t)\n        required = len(target_count)\n        formed = 0\n        window_count = {}\n        \n        l, r = 0, 0\n        ans = float(\"inf\"), None, None\n        \n        while r < len(s):\n            character = s[r]\n            window_count[character] = window_count.get(character, 0) + 1\n            \n            if character in target_count and window_count[character] == target_count[character]:\n                formed += 1\n            \n            while l <= r and formed == required:\n                character = s[l]\n                \n                if r - l + 1 < ans[0]:\n                    ans = (r - l + 1, l, r)\n                \n                window_count[character] -= 1\n                if character in target_count and window_count[character] < target_count[character]:\n                    formed -= 1\n                \n                l += 1\n            \n            r += 1\n        \n        return \"\" if ans[1] is None else s[ans[1]: ans[2] + 1]\n"},"SubmissionId":1760936320,"CheckResponse":{"status_code":10,"status_msg":"Accepted","Finished":true,"State":"SUCCESS"},"SubmittedAt":"2025-09-06T00:19:40.625620807+02:00"}}}
