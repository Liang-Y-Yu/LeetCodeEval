This satisfies the problem requirements.\n\n2. **Edge Cases**:\n   - The code handles scenarios where a room contains no keys (e.g., visiting empty sets and continuing the search without adding keys to the stack).\n   - It correctly processes scenarios where rooms contain keys leading back to already visited rooms by avoiding revisiting them.\n\n3. **Complexity**:\n   - The time complexity of the solution is O(n + E) where n is the number of rooms and E is the total number of keys.\n   - Space complexity is O(n) because it uses a set to keep track of visited rooms and a stack for DFS traversal. Given the constraints (rooms count up to 1000 and total keys up to 3000), this is efficient and acceptable.\n\n4. **Code Quality**:\n   - The code is clean and well-structured. It follows good practices like using a set for visited checks and a stack for iterative DFS.\n   - Variable names (`visited`, `stack`, `room`, `key`) are descriptive, contributing to the readability of the code.\n\n5. **Test Cases**:\n   - The provided examples are thoroughly covered, with the code successfully outputting the correct results as indicated in the problem statement:\n     - For `rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]`, the output is `True`.\n     - For `rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]`, the output is `False`.\n   \n6. **Potential Issues**:\n   - There are no apparent bugs or logical errors. The implementation is robust given the problem constraints.\n   - No improvements are needed; the solution works efficiently within the constraints and handles the identified edge cases.\n\nIn conclusion, the solution is valid, efficient, and appropriately handles the task according to the problem statement and constraints. The code is ready to be executed as-is.\n\nHere is the finalized code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n        visited = set()\n        stack = [0]\n        \n        while stack:\n            room = stack.pop()\n            if room not in visited:\n                visited.add(room)\n                for key in rooms[room]:\n                    if key not in visited:\n                        stack.append(key)\n        \n        return len(visited) == len(rooms)\n```\n\n","TypedCode":"\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n        visited = set()\n        stack = [0]\n        \n        while stack:\n            room = stack.pop()\n            if room not in visited:\n                visited.add(room)\n                for key in rooms[room]:\n                    if key not in visited:\n                        stack.append(key)\n        \n        return len(visited) == len(rooms)\n","Model":"se-gpt-4o","Latency":8430022011,"SolvedAt":"2025-09-06T22:58:19.995774026+02:00","PromptTokens":3569,"OutputTokens":952}},"Submissions":{"se-gpt-4o":{"SubmitRequest":{"lang":"python3","question_id":"871","typed_code":"\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n        visited = set()\n        stack = [0]\n        \n        while stack:\n            room = stack.pop()\n            if room not in visited:\n                visited.add(room)\n                for key in rooms[room]:\n                    if key not in visited:\n                        stack.append(key)\n        \n        return len(visited) == len(rooms)\n"},"SubmissionId":1761933018,"CheckResponse":{"status_code":10,"status_msg":"Accepted","Finished":true,"State":"SUCCESS"},"SubmittedAt":"2025-09-06T23:28:04.73712729+02:00"}}}
