1] == word2[j - 1]:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + 1\n        \n        return dp[m][n]\n```\n\n**Verification Report:**\n\n1. **Correctness**: \n   - The code correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to calculate the edit distance using the three allowed operations: insert, delete, and replace. \n   - The recurrence relation is correctly applied, ensuring that the solution considers matching characters (no operation needed) and mismatched characters (performing the minimum operation among delete, insert, or replace).\n\n2. **Edge Cases**:\n   - The code handles edge cases such as empty strings (`word1` or `word2` being empty) by initializing the base cases where one of the strings is empty, requiring simple insertions or deletions.\n   - When both are empty, the function correctly returns `0`.\n\n3. **Complexity**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: The solution runs in O(m * n) time, where m and n are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively. This is due to the nested iteration over the DP table.\n   - **Space Complexity**: It uses O(m * n) space for the DP table, which can be optimized further to O(min(m, n)) if needed (not required here but a possible improvement).\n\n4. **Code Quality**:\n   - The code is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices in readability and maintainability.\n   - Variable names `m`, `n`, and `dp` are concise yet descriptive for the context of dynamic programming.\n\n5. **Test Cases**:\n   - The provided examples yield the correct outputs according to the problem statement:\n     - `\"horse\"` to `\"ros\"` results in `3` operations.\n     - `\"intention\"` to `\"execution\"` results in `5` operations.\n   - Other plausible edge cases, such as one or both strings being empty, return expected and reasonable results.\n\n6. **Potential Issues**:\n   - No apparent bugs or logical errors are present. The solution is accurate for the problem's constraints, handles the edge cases, and performs efficiently within the limits described.\n\nOverall, the implemented solution is correct and meets all the conditions outlined in the problem requirements. There are no modifications required for functionality or complexity optimization given the problem constraints.\n\n","TypedCode":"\nclass Solution:\n    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:\n        m, n = len(word1), len(word2)\n        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n        \n        for i in range(m + 1):\n            dp[i][0] = i\n        \n        for j in range(n + 1):\n            dp[0][j] = j\n        \n        for i in range(1, m + 1):\n            for j in range(1, n + 1):\n                if word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + 1\n        \n        return dp[m][n]\n","Model":"se-gpt-4o","Latency":13333458691,"SolvedAt":"2025-09-06T22:55:11.272258722+02:00","PromptTokens":4584,"OutputTokens":1675}},"Submissions":{"se-gpt-4o":{"SubmitRequest":{"lang":"python3","question_id":"72","typed_code":"\nclass Solution:\n    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:\n        m, n = len(word1), len(word2)\n        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n        \n        for i in range(m + 1):\n            dp[i][0] = i\n        \n        for j in range(n + 1):\n            dp[0][j] = j\n        \n        for i in range(1, m + 1):\n            for j in range(1, n + 1):\n                if word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + 1\n        \n        return dp[m][n]\n"},"SubmissionId":1761929187,"CheckResponse":{"status_code":10,"status_msg":"Accepted","Finished":true,"State":"SUCCESS"},"SubmittedAt":"2025-09-06T23:20:47.525060793+02:00"}}}
