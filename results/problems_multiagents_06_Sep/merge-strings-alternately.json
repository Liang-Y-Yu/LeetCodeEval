The approach is consistent with the problem statement and examples given.\n\n2. **Edge Cases**: The code handles all edge cases, including scenarios where:\n   - `word1` is longer than `word2`.\n   - `word2` is longer than `word1`.\n   - Both strings are equal in length.\n   Given constraints guarantee minimum length is 1, so no concern for empty strings.\n\n3. **Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the sum of lengths of `word1` and `word2`, due to a single pass over the minimal length and appending the remaining part. The space complexity is O(n) as well for storing merged characters.\n\n4. **Code Quality**: The code is clean, readable, and adheres to Python best practices, utilizing list for accumulation and list comprehension for appending remaining sections in the merging process. \n\n5. **Test Cases**: The given examples and explanation thoroughly demonstrate the method's functionality:\n   - For input `\"abc\"` and `\"pqr\"`, output is `\"apbqcr\"`.\n   - For input `\"ab\"` and `\"pqrs\"`, output is `\"apbqrs\"`.\n   - For input `\"abcd\"` and `\"pq\"`, output is `\"apbqcd\"`.\n\n6. **Potential Issues**: There seems to be no logical errors or inefficiencies. The problem constraints make the solution efficient within given limits.\n\nOverall, the solution is valid, correctly handles the described scenarios, and outputs the expected results for provided test cases.\n\n","TypedCode":"\nclass Solution:\n    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:\n        merged = []\n        len1, len2 = len(word1), len(word2)\n        min_length = min(len1, len2)\n        \n        for i in range(min_length):\n            merged.append(word1[i])\n            merged.append(word2[i])\n        \n        if len1 > len2:\n            merged.append(word1[min_length:])\n        elif len2 > len1:\n            merged.append(word2[min_length:])\n        \n        return ''.join(merged)\n","Model":"se-gpt-4o","Latency":6579911469,"SolvedAt":"2025-09-06T23:01:23.319305526+02:00","PromptTokens":3511,"OutputTokens":853}},"Submissions":{"se-gpt-4o":{"SubmitRequest":{"lang":"python3","question_id":"1894","typed_code":"\nclass Solution:\n    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:\n        merged = []\n        len1, len2 = len(word1), len(word2)\n        min_length = min(len1, len2)\n        \n        for i in range(min_length):\n            merged.append(word1[i])\n            merged.append(word2[i])\n        \n        if len1 > len2:\n            merged.append(word1[min_length:])\n        elif len2 > len1:\n            merged.append(word2[min_length:])\n        \n        return ''.join(merged)\n"},"SubmissionId":1761936376,"CheckResponse":{"status_code":10,"status_msg":"Accepted","Finished":true,"State":"SUCCESS"},"SubmittedAt":"2025-09-06T23:34:44.012985072+02:00"}}}
