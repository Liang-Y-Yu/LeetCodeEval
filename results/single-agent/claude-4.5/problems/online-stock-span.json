You will be given:\n* A problem statement (with sample test cases if available).\n* A starter code snippet (with fixed function signatures).\n\nPlease write your solution in the python3 programming language. Your code must:\n* Solve the problem fully and correctly.\n* Pass all provided sample test cases.\n* Run within acceptable time and memory limits (assume large inputs if none are specified).\n* Follow good coding practices (clear logic, readable structure, appropriate use of language features).\n\nHere is the problem statement: Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.\nThe span of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price of that day.\n\tFor example, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,2,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 2, then the span of today is 4 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 2 for 4 consecutive days.\n\tAlso, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,34,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 8, then the span of today is 3 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 8 for 3 consecutive days.\nImplement the StockSpanner class:\n\tStockSpanner() Initializes the object of the class.\n\tint next(int price) Returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is price.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput\n[\"StockSpanner\", \"next\", \"next\", \"next\", \"next\", \"next\", \"next\", \"next\"]\n[[], [100], [80], [60], [70], [60], [75], [85]]\nOutput\n[null, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]\nExplanation\nStockSpanner stockSpanner = new StockSpanner();\nstockSpanner.next(100); // return 1\nstockSpanner.next(80);  // return 1\nstockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1\nstockSpanner.next(70);  // return 2\nstockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1\nstockSpanner.next(75);  // return 4, because the last 4 prices (including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.\nstockSpanner.next(85);  // return 6\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\t1 <= price <= 10^5\n\tAt most 10^4 calls will be made to next.\n\nHere is the code snippet, which you should expand with your solution: class StockSpanner:\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        \n\n    def next(self, price: int) -> int:\n        \n\n\n# Your StockSpanner object will be instantiated and called as such:\n# obj = StockSpanner()\n# param_1 = obj.next(price)\n\nImportant Requirements:\n* Do not change any provided function signatures, class names, or method names.\n* Output only valid source code that can be executed as-is, without any further improvements or bugfixes.\n* Do not include docstrings, markdown, or commentary in your final code.\n\nGood luck!\n",
      "Answer": "Looking at this problem, I need to find the span - the number of consecutive days (going backwards from today) where the price was less than or equal to today's price.\n\nThe key insight is to use a monotonic decreasing stack. The stack will store pairs of (price, span) where:\n- We pop elements from the stack while their price is less than or equal to the current price\n- As we pop, we accumulate the spans of those days\n- We push the current price with its calculated span\n\nThis works because if a previous day has a price <= current price, all the days that previous day could \"see\" (its span), the current day can also \"see\".\n\nLet me trace through the example:\n- next(100): stack empty, span=1, stack=[(100,1)]\n- next(80): 80<=100 is false, span=1, stack=[(100,1),(80,1)]\n- next(60): 60<=80 is false, span=1, stack=[(100,1),(80,1),(60,1)]\n- next(70): 70<=60 is false... wait, that's not right. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, we want to pop while the top's price is <= current price:\n- next(100): stack empty, span=1, stack=[(100,1)]\n- next(80): 80<100, can't pop, span=1, stack=[(100,1),(80,1)]\n- next(60): 60<80, can't pop, span=1, stack=[(100,1),(80,1),(60,1)]\n- next(70): 60<=70, pop (60,1), span=1+1=2, 80<=70 is false, stop. stack=[(100,1),(80,1),(70,2)]\n- next(60): 60<70, can't pop, span=1, stack=[(100,1),(80,1),(70,2),(60,1)]\n- next(75): 60<=75 pop, span=1+1=2; 70<=75 pop, span=2+2=4; 80<=75 is false, stop. stack=[(100,1),(80,1),(75,4)]\n- next(85): 75<=85 pop, span=1+4=5; 80<=85 pop, span=5+1=6; 100<=85 is false, stop. stack=[(100,1),(85,6)]\n\nThis gives us the correct answer!\n\n```python\nclass StockSpanner:\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.stack = []\n\n    def next(self, price: int) -> int:\n        span = 1\n        while self.stack and self.stack[-1][0] <= price:\n            span += self.stack.pop()[1]\n        self.stack.append((price, span))\n        return span\n```",
