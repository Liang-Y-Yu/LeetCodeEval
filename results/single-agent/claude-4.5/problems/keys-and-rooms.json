      "Prompt": "Hi, this is a coding interview. You will be given:\n* A problem statement (with sample test cases if available).\n* A starter code snippet (with fixed function signatures).\n\nPlease write your solution in the python3 programming language. Your code must:\n* Solve the problem fully and correctly.\n* Pass all provided sample test cases.\n* Run within acceptable time and memory limits (assume large inputs if none are specified).\n* Follow good coding practices (clear logic, readable structure, appropriate use of language features).\n\nHere is the problem statement: There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1\u00a0and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.\nWhen you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.\nGiven an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nWe visit room 0 and pick up key 1.\nWe then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.\nWe then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.\nWe then visit room 3.\nSince we were able to visit every room, we return true.\nExample 2:\nInput: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\tn == rooms.length\n\t2 <= n <= 1000\n\t0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000\n\t1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000\n\t0 <= rooms[i][j] < n\n\tAll the values of rooms[i] are unique.\n\nHere is the code snippet, which you should expand with your solution: class Solution:\n    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n        \n\nImportant Requirements:\n* Do not change any provided function signatures, class names, or method names.\n* Output only valid source code that can be executed as-is, without any further improvements or bugfixes.\n* Do not include docstrings, markdown, or commentary in your final code.\n\nGood luck!\n",
      "Answer": "Looking at this problem, I need to determine if all rooms can be visited starting from room 0.\n\nThis is essentially a graph traversal problem where:\n- Each room is a node\n- Each key in a room represents a directed edge to another room\n- I start at room 0 and need to check if all rooms are reachable\n\nI can use either BFS or DFS to traverse the rooms. I'll keep track of visited rooms and collect keys as I go.\n\nHere's my approach:\n1. Start at room 0 (it's unlocked)\n2. Use a set to track visited rooms\n3. Use a queue/stack to track rooms I can visit\n4. For each room I visit, collect all keys and add unvisited rooms to my queue\n5. At the end, check if I've visited all rooms\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n        n = len(rooms)\n        visited = set()\n        stack = [0]\n        \n        while stack:\n            room = stack.pop()\n            if room in visited:\n                continue\n            visited.add(room)\n            for key in rooms[room]:\n                if key not in visited:\n                    stack.append(key)\n        \n        return len(visited) == n\n```",
