      "Prompt": "Hi, this is a coding interview. You will be given:\n* A problem statement (with sample test cases if available).\n* A starter code snippet (with fixed function signatures).\n\nPlease write your solution in the python3 programming language. Your code must:\n* Solve the problem fully and correctly.\n* Pass all provided sample test cases.\n* Run within acceptable time and memory limits (assume large inputs if none are specified).\n* Follow good coding practices (clear logic, readable structure, appropriate use of language features).\n\nHere is the problem statement: You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height. The billboard will have two steel supports, one on each side. Each steel support must be an equal height.\nYou are given a collection of rods that can be welded together. For example, if you have rods of lengths 1, 2, and 3, you can weld them together to make a support of length 6.\nReturn the largest possible height of your billboard installation. If you cannot support the billboard, return 0.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: rods = [1,2,3,6]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: We have two disjoint subsets {1,2,3} and {6}, which have the same sum = 6.\nExample 2:\nInput: rods = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: We have two disjoint subsets {2,3,5} and {4,6}, which have the same sum = 10.\nExample 3:\nInput: rods = [1,2]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The billboard cannot be supported, so we return 0.\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\t1 <= rods.length <= 20\n\t1 <= rods[i] <= 1000\n\tsum(rods[i]) <= 5000\n\nHere is the code snippet, which you should expand with your solution: class Solution:\n    def tallestBillboard(self, rods: List[int]) -> int:\n        \n\nImportant Requirements:\n* Do not change any provided function signatures, class names, or method names.\n* Output only valid source code that can be executed as-is, without any further improvements or bugfixes.\n* Do not include docstrings, markdown, or commentary in your final code.\n\nGood luck!\n",
      "Answer": "Looking at this problem, I need to find two disjoint subsets of rods with equal sums, and maximize that sum.\n\nThis is a variant of the partition problem. I'll use dynamic programming where I track the difference between two supports.\n\nKey insight: For each rod, I have 3 choices:\n1. Add it to the left support\n2. Add it to the right support  \n3. Don't use it\n\nI'll use DP where `dp[diff]` represents the maximum sum of the smaller support when the difference between the two supports is `diff`.\n\nThe approach:\n- State: `dp[diff]` = maximum height of the shorter support when the difference between supports is `diff`\n- For each rod, I update all possible states\n- Final answer: `dp[0]` (when difference is 0, both supports have equal height)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def tallestBillboard(self, rods: List[int]) -> int:\n        dp = {0: 0}\n        \n        for rod in rods:\n            new_dp = dp.copy()\n            \n            for diff, shorter in dp.items():\n                longer = shorter + diff\n                \n                new_diff = diff + rod\n                new_dp[new_diff] = max(new_dp.get(new_diff, 0), shorter)\n                \n                new_diff = abs(diff - rod)\n                if diff >= rod:\n                    new_dp[new_diff] = max(new_dp.get(new_diff, 0), shorter)\n                else:\n                    new_shorter = shorter + diff\n                    new_dp[new_diff] = max(new_dp.get(new_diff, 0), new_shorter)\n            \n            dp = new_dp\n        \n        return dp.get(0, 0)\n```\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The state management is a bit tricky. Let me think more clearly:\n\n- `dp[diff]` = the maximum height of the taller support when `taller - shorter = diff`\n\nActually, a cleaner approach: `dp[diff]` = maximum value of the shorter pile when the difference is `diff`.\n\nFor each rod of length `r`:\n1. Add to taller pile: `diff` increases by `r`, shorter stays same\n2. Add to shorter pile: \n   - If `r < diff`: new diff = `diff - r`, shorter increases by `r`\n   - If `r >= diff`: roles swap, new diff = `r - diff`, new shorter = old_shorter + diff\n3. Don't add: state unchanged\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def tallestBillboard(self, rods: List[int]) -> int:\n        dp = {0: 0}\n        \n        for rod in rods:\n            new_dp = dp.copy()\n            \n            for diff, shorter in dp.items():\n                new_dp[diff + rod] = max(new_dp.get(diff + rod, 0), shorter)\n                \n                new_diff = abs(diff - rod)\n                if diff >= rod:\n                    new_shorter = shorter + rod\n                else:\n                    new_shorter = shorter + diff\n                new_dp[new_diff] = max(new_dp.get(new_diff, 0), new_shorter)\n            \n            dp = new_dp\n        \n        return dp.get(0, 0)\n```",
