      "Prompt": "Hi, this is a coding interview. You will be given:\n* A problem statement (with sample test cases if available).\n* A starter code snippet (with fixed function signatures).\n\nPlease write your solution in the python3 programming language. Your code must:\n* Solve the problem fully and correctly.\n* Pass all provided sample test cases.\n* Run within acceptable time and memory limits (assume large inputs if none are specified).\n* Follow good coding practices (clear logic, readable structure, appropriate use of language features).\n\nHere is the problem statement: Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high\u00a0(inclusive).\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: low = 3, high = 7\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].\nExample 2:\nInput: low = 8, high = 10\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\t0 <= low <= high\u00a0<= 10^9\n\nHere is the code snippet, which you should expand with your solution: class Solution:\n    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:\n        \n\nImportant Requirements:\n* Do not change any provided function signatures, class names, or method names.\n* Output only valid source code that can be executed as-is, without any further improvements or bugfixes.\n* Do not include docstrings, markdown, or commentary in your final code.\n\nGood luck!\n",
