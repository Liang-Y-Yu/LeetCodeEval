      "Answer": "An elegant solution to this problem comes from thinking about it in terms of information theory. The goal is to distinguish which of the `buckets` is poisonous. Each pig's fate provides us with information. The minimum number of pigs is determined by the total amount of information required.\n\nFirst, let's determine how much information a single pig can provide. The experiment can be run in discrete rounds. Each round consists of feeding pigs and then waiting `minutesToDie` to see the result. The total time available is `minutesToTest`. Therefore, we can run `minutesToTest // minutesToDie` full rounds of tests.\n\nLet `tests = minutesToTest // minutesToDie`.\n\nA single pig can be used in these tests sequentially.\n*   The pig can be fed a selection of buckets at time 0. If it dies, it will be at time `minutesToDie`. This is one possible outcome.\n*   If it survives the first round, it can be fed another set of buckets at time `minutesToDie`. If it dies this time, it will be at time `2 * minutesToDie`. This is a second outcome.\n*   This continues for all possible `tests` rounds.\n*   Finally, the pig might survive all rounds of testing. This is one more possible outcome.\n\nSo, for one pig, there are `tests + 1` possible distinct outcomes (dying in round 1, 2, ..., `tests`, or surviving). Let's call this number `states`.\n`states = (minutesToTest // minutesToDie) + 1`.\n\nNow, consider we have `p` pigs. Since each pig's testing is independent, the total number of combined outcomes we can distinguish is the product of the number of states for each pig. With `p` pigs, we can distinguish `states * states * ... * states` (`p` times), which is `states^p` unique outcomes.\n\nTo find the one poisonous bucket out of `buckets` possibilities, we must have enough unique outcomes to assign one to each bucket. Thus, we need:\n`states^p >= buckets`\n\nWe are looking for the minimum integer `p` that satisfies this inequality. We can solve for `p` using logarithms, but a more robust way that avoids floating-point arithmetic is to use a simple loop. We can start with 0 pigs and iteratively increase the number of pigs, calculating the number of buckets that can be handled (`states^p`), until this number is sufficient.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the number of states a single pig can represent: `states = (minutesToTest // minutesToDie) + 1`.\n2.  Initialize the number of pigs to 0. With 0 pigs, we can \"identify\" 1 bucket (if there's only one, we know it's poisonous without testing).\n3.  Loop, incrementing the number of pigs. In each step, update the number of buckets we can test by multiplying by `states`.\n4.  Stop when the number of testable buckets is greater than or equal to the actual number of buckets. The number of pigs at this point is the minimum required.\n\nFor example, if `buckets = 4`, `minutesToDie = 15`, `minutesToTest = 15`:\n*   `states = (15 // 15) + 1 = 2`.\n*   We need `2^p >= 4`.\n*   `p=0`: `2^0 = 1 < 4`\n*   `p=1`: `2^1 = 2 < 4`\n*   `p=2`: `2^2 = 4 >= 4`. Minimum pigs is 2.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:\n        \n        # A pig can have (minutesToTest // minutesToDie) + 1 states.\n        # It can die in any of the (minutesToTest // minutesToDie) test rounds,\n        # or it can survive.\n        states = (minutesToTest // minutesToDie) + 1\n        \n        # We need to find the minimum number of pigs 'p' such that:\n        # states^p >= buckets\n        # This can be solved by iterating 'p' from 0 upwards.\n        \n        pigs = 0\n        power_of_states = 1\n        while power_of_states < buckets:\n            power_of_states *= states\n            pigs += 1\n            \n        return pigs\n\n```",
