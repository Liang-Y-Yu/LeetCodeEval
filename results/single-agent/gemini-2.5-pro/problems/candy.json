      "Prompt": "Hi, this is a coding interview. You will be given:\n* A problem statement (with sample test cases if available).\n* A starter code snippet (with fixed function signatures).\n\nPlease write your solution in the python3 programming language. Your code must:\n* Solve the problem fully and correctly.\n* Pass all provided sample test cases.\n* Run within acceptable time and memory limits (assume large inputs if none are specified).\n* Follow good coding practices (clear logic, readable structure, appropriate use of language features).\n\nHere is the problem statement: There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.\nYou are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:\n\tEach child must have at least one candy.\n\tChildren with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.\nReturn the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: ratings = [1,0,2]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.\nExample 2:\nInput: ratings = [1,2,2]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.\nThe third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\tn == ratings.length\n\t1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4\n\t0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10^4\n\nHere is the code snippet, which you should expand with your solution: class Solution:\n    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:\n        \n\nImportant Requirements:\n* Do not change any provided function signatures, class names, or method names.\n* Output only valid source code that can be executed as-is, without any further improvements or bugfixes.\n* Do not include docstrings, markdown, or commentary in your final code.\n\nGood luck!\n",
