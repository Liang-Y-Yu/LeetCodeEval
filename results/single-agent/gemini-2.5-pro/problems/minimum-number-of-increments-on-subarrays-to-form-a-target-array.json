      "Answer": "An elegant and efficient solution can be found by iterating through the target array from left to right. The key insight is to realize that the minimum number of operations is equivalent to the sum of all upward \"steps\" in the target array's profile.\n\nLet's maintain a variable, say `previous_height`, representing the value we have managed to build up in the `initial` array at the previous position. Initially, `previous_height` is 0, since the `initial` array starts with all zeros.\n\nWhen we consider the `i`-th element, `target[i]`, we compare it with `previous_height`.\n\n1.  If `target[i]` is greater than `previous_height`, it means the \"height\" of our array needs to increase. The operations that contributed to `previous_height` are not sufficient. We need `target[i] - previous_height` additional increments. Each of these increments must come from a new operation that starts at or before index `i` and was not needed for the previous elements. Therefore, we must add `target[i] - previous_height` to our total operation count.\n\n2.  If `target[i]` is less than or equal to `previous_height`, it means the operations that were \"active\" at the previous position are sufficient to achieve the desired height `target[i]`. No new operations need to be started at this position. Some operations that were active at `i-1` are now terminated, but this does not increase the operation count.\n\nAfter processing `target[i]`, the \"built-up\" height that can be carried over to the next position `i+1` is `target[i]`. So, we update `previous_height` to `target[i]` and move to the next element.\n\nThe total number of operations will be the sum of increments required at each step where the target height increases.\n\nFor example, with `target = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`:\n- Start with `ops = 0`, `prev_height = 0`.\n- `target[0] = 1`: `1 > 0`, so `ops` becomes `0 + (1-0) = 1`. `prev_height` is now `1`.\n- `target[1] = 2`: `2 > 1`, so `ops` becomes `1 + (2-1) = 2`. `prev_height` is now `2`.\n- `target[2] = 3`: `3 > 2`, so `ops` becomes `2 + (3-2) = 3`. `prev_height` is now `3`.\n- `target[3] = 2`: `2 <= 3`, `ops` is unchanged. `prev_height` is now `2`.\n- `target[4] = 1`: `1 <= 2`, `ops` is unchanged. `prev_height` is now `1`.\nThe final result is 3.\n\nThis approach results in a single pass through the array, leading to a time complexity of O(N) and a space complexity of O(1), where N is the length of the `target` array.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n  def minNumberOperations(self, target: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of operations to form the target array.\n\n    An operation consists of incrementing a contiguous subarray by one.\n    The initial array is all zeros.\n\n    The logic is based on a single pass through the target array.\n    We track the accumulated \"height\" from previous operations.\n    Whenever the current target element is higher than the previous height,\n    it means we need to start new operations. The number of new operations\n    is the difference between the current target height and the previous height.\n    \"\"\"\n    operations = 0\n    previous_height = 0\n    \n    for current_height in target:\n      if current_height > previous_height:\n        operations += current_height - previous_height\n      \n      previous_height = current_height\n      \n    return operations\n\n```",
