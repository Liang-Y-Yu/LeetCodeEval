      "Prompt": "Hi, this is a coding interview. You will be given:\n* A problem statement (with sample test cases if available).\n* A starter code snippet (with fixed function signatures).\n\nPlease write your solution in the python3 programming language. Your code must:\n* Solve the problem fully and correctly.\n* Pass all provided sample test cases.\n* Run within acceptable time and memory limits (assume large inputs if none are specified).\n* Follow good coding practices (clear logic, readable structure, appropriate use of language features).\n\nHere is the problem statement: You are given an array time where time[i] denotes the time taken by the i^th bus to complete one trip.\nEach bus can make multiple trips successively; that is, the next trip can start immediately after completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates independently; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.\nYou are also given an integer totalTrips, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make in total. Return the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least totalTrips trips.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: time = [1,2,3], totalTrips = 5\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\n- At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1,0,0]. \n  The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.\n- At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2,1,0]. \n  The total number of trips completed is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.\n- At time t = 3, the number of trips completed by each bus are [3,1,1]. \n  The total number of trips completed is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\nSo the minimum time needed for all buses to complete at least 5 trips is 3.\nExample 2:\nInput: time = [2], totalTrips = 1\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nThere is only one bus, and it will complete its first trip at t = 2.\nSo the minimum time needed to complete 1 trip is 2.\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\t1 <= time.length <= 10^5\n\t1 <= time[i], totalTrips <= 10^7\n\nHere is the code snippet, which you should expand with your solution: class Solution:\n    def minimumTime(self, time: List[int], totalTrips: int) -> int:\n        \n\nImportant Requirements:\n* Do not change any provided function signatures, class names, or method names.\n* Output only valid source code that can be executed as-is, without any further improvements or bugfixes.\n* Do not include docstrings, markdown, or commentary in your final code.\n\nGood luck!\n",
