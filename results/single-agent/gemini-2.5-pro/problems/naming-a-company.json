      "Answer": "An elegant and efficient solution to this problem involves grouping the `ideas` by their first letter. The core insight is that a pair of ideas, `ideaA` and `ideaB`, can only form a valid company name if, after swapping their initial letters, the resulting new strings do not already exist in the original `ideas` list. This validity depends solely on the initial letters and the suffixes of `ideaA` and `ideaB`.\n\nLet's break down the approach:\n\n1.  **Grouping by Initial Letter:**\n    We can preprocess the `ideas` list by creating 26 groups, one for each letter of the alphabet. Each group will store the set of suffixes of all ideas that start with that particular letter. For example, if `ideas` contains \"coffee\" and \"cat\", the group for 'c' would contain the suffixes {\"offee\", \"at\"}. Using a `set` for suffixes automatically handles duplicates and allows for efficient operations later.\n\n2.  **Counting Valid Pairs:**\n    A pair of ideas `(ideaA, ideaB)` can only be problematic if they share the same starting letter. If `ideaA` and `ideaB` start with the same letter, swapping their first letters results in the original strings `ideaB` and `ideaA`, which are already in the `ideas` list, making the pair invalid. Therefore, we only need to consider pairs of ideas with different starting letters.\n\n    Let's consider two distinct groups of ideas, one starting with character `c1` and the other with `c2`. Let their suffix sets be `suffixes1` and `suffixes2`, respectively.\n\n    We choose `ideaA` from the `c1` group (so `ideaA = c1 + s1` where `s1` is in `suffixes1`) and `ideaB` from the `c2` group (`ideaB = c2 + s2` where `s2` is in `suffixes2`).\n\n    After swapping, the new strings are `newA = c2 + s1` and `newB = c1 + s2`.\n    For the pair `(ideaA, ideaB)` to be valid:\n    *   `newA` must not be in `ideas`. This means `s1` must not be in `suffixes2`.\n    *   `newB` must not be in `ideas`. This means `s2` must not be in `suffixes1`.\n\n    So, to form a valid pair, we must choose a suffix `s1` from `suffixes1` that is not in `suffixes2`, and a suffix `s2` from `suffixes2` that is not in `suffixes1`.\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    For each pair of character groups `(c1, c2)`:\n    a. Find the number of suffixes common to both `suffixes1` and `suffixes2`. Let this be `num_common`.\n    b. The number of suffixes unique to `suffixes1` (relative to `suffixes2`) is `len(suffixes1) - num_common`. Let this be `distinct1`.\n    c. The number of suffixes unique to `suffixes2` (relative to `suffixes1`) is `len(suffixes2) - num_common`. Let this be `distinct2`.\n\n    The number of valid ordered pairs `(ideaA, ideaB)` where `ideaA` starts with `c1` and `ideaB` starts with `c2` is `distinct1 * distinct2`.\n\n    The problem asks for the total number of distinct valid names. The examples show that `(ideaA, ideaB)` and `(ideaB, ideaA)` are counted as two distinct selections if both are valid. The validity condition is symmetric, so if one is valid, the other is too.\n    \n    Therefore, for each pair of character groups, the contribution to the total count is `(distinct1 * distinct2)` for `(c1, c2)` pairs plus `(distinct2 * distinct1)` for `(c2, c1)` pairs, which sums to `2 * distinct1 * distinct2`.\n\nBy iterating through all unique pairs of character groups and summing these contributions, we can find the total count efficiently.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def distinctNames(self, ideas: List[str]) -> int:\n        # Group suffixes by their initial character.\n        # An array of sets, where index 0 is for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.\n        groups = [set() for _ in range(26)]\n        for idea in ideas:\n            groups[ord(idea[0]) - ord('a')].add(idea[1:])\n            \n        answer = 0\n        # Iterate over all distinct pairs of character groups.\n        for i in range(26):\n            for j in range(i + 1, 26):\n                # Calculate the number of common suffixes between two groups.\n                num_common = len(groups[i].intersection(groups[j]))\n                \n                # Number of suffixes in group i not present in group j.\n                distinct1 = len(groups[i]) - num_common\n                # Number of suffixes in group j not present in group i.\n                distinct2 = len(groups[j]) - num_common\n                \n                # For each pair of unique suffixes (one from each group),\n                # two valid names can be formed by swapping their initial letters.\n                # (idea_i, idea_j) and (idea_j, idea_i).\n                answer += 2 * distinct1 * distinct2\n                \n        return answer\n\n```",
