      "Answer": "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the complete, runnable code.\nThe problem is to find the minimum possible weight of the last remaining stone. Each operation consists of taking two stones of weights `x` and `y` and replacing them with `|x - y|`.\n\nThis problem can be transformed into a classic partition problem. Let's consider the stones partitioned into two groups, `S1` and `S2`. The sum of weights in each group are `sum(S1)` and `sum(S2)`. The final result of all the smashing operations will be equivalent to `|sum(S1) - sum(S2)|`. This is because each smash `(x, y) -> |x-y|` can be thought of as assigning one stone's weight to a positive group and the other to a negative group. The goal is to make the final absolute sum as small as possible.\n\nLet the total weight of all stones be `TotalSum`. If we find a partition `S1`, its sum is `s1`. The other partition `S2` will have a sum of `s2 = TotalSum - s1`. The difference is `|s1 - s2| = |s1 - (TotalSum - s1)| = |2*s1 - TotalSum|`.\n\nTo minimize this difference, `2*s1` should be as close as possible to `TotalSum`, which means `s1` should be as close as possible to `TotalSum / 2`.\n\nThis transforms the problem into finding a subset of `stones` whose sum is as large as possible but not exceeding `TotalSum / 2`. This is a variation of the 0/1 Knapsack problem. We can solve it using dynamic programming.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be a boolean indicating whether a subset sum of `i` is possible. We initialize `dp[0]` to `True` (an empty set has a sum of 0) and aim to find all possible subset sums up to `target = TotalSum / 2`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Calculate `TotalSum` of all stones.\n2. Define the `target` sum as `TotalSum / 2`.\n3. Create a DP array `dp` of size `target + 1`, where `dp[i]` will be true if sum `i` is achievable. Initialize `dp[0] = True`.\n4. For each stone, iterate through the `dp` array backwards from `target` down to the stone's weight. Update `dp[j]` to `True` if `dp[j - stone_weight]` is `True`.\n5. After processing all stones, find the largest index `i` from `target` down to `0` for which `dp[i]` is `True`. This `i` is the sum of one partition (`s1`).\n6. The minimum possible weight of the final stone is `TotalSum - 2*i`.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n        total_sum = sum(stones)\n        target = total_sum // 2\n        \n        dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n        dp[0] = True\n        \n        for stone in stones:\n            for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):\n                dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n\n        for i in range(target, -1, -1):\n            if dp[i]:\n                s1 = i\n                s2 = total_sum - s1\n                return s2 - s1\n        \n        # This part should be unreachable given the problem constraints\n        # and dp[0] being True.\n        return total_sum\n```",
