      "Answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum total cost to make all elements of the array `nums` equal by either increasing or decreasing any element by 1, with the cost of each operation on the i-th element given by `cost[i]`. The challenge is to determine the target value that minimizes the total cost and compute that cost efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires transforming all elements of `nums` to a common value with minimal cost. Each operation on an element `i` has a cost `cost[i]` per unit change. The solution involves finding a target value `x` such that the total cost to adjust every element to `x` is minimized.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The total cost function `f(x) = \u03a3 cost[i] * |nums[i] - x|` is a convex function in `x`. This means it has a single minimum. We can use binary search to find the value of `x` that minimizes this function. However, note that the problem constraints (n up to 10^5) require an efficient solution.\n\n3. **Alternate Insight (Weighted Median)**: Actually, the problem can be reduced to finding the weighted median of the `nums` array with weights given by `cost`. The weighted median is the value `x` that minimizes the weighted absolute deviations. This is because the cost function is linear in the absolute differences and the minimum occurs at the median of the distribution weighted by `cost`.\n\n4. **Steps**:\n   - Combine `nums` and `cost` into pairs and sort these pairs by `nums`.\n   - Compute the total weight (sum of all `cost`).\n   - Traverse the sorted list while accumulating the weights. The weighted median is the value `nums[i]` for which the cumulative weight first reaches or exceeds half the total weight.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - Create a list of pairs (num, cost) and sort by `num`.\n   - Calculate the total cost `total_cost_sum = sum(cost)`.\n   - Initialize a variable `median_index = total_cost_sum // 2` (but note: for even total weight, both medians are candidates? Actually, the weighted median is defined as the smallest value `x` such that the cumulative weight is at least half the total. However, since the cost function is convex, the minimum will be at the median.\n   - Iterate through the sorted list, accumulating the cost. When the cumulative cost reaches or exceeds `median_index`, the corresponding `num` is the target value that minimizes the cost.\n   - Alternatively, we can note that the median is the value where the cumulative weight first becomes >= total_weight/2. So we can set `target = nums[i]` at that point.\n   - Once the target is found, compute the total cost by summing `cost[i] * |nums[i] - target|` for all `i`.\n\n6. **Efficiency**: Sorting the list takes O(n log n) time, and the subsequent steps are linear. This is efficient for n up to 10^5.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minCost(self, nums: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        pairs = sorted(zip(nums, cost), key=lambda x: x[0])\n        total_weight = sum(cost)\n        cum_weight = 0\n        target = pairs[0][0]\n        for num, c in pairs:\n            cum_weight += c\n            if cum_weight >= total_weight / 2:\n                target = num\n                break\n        \n        total_cost = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            total_cost += abs(nums[i] - target) * cost[i]\n        return total_cost\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting and Pairing**: The code first combines each element of `nums` with its corresponding `cost` into a tuple and sorts these tuples based on the `nums` values. This helps in efficiently finding the weighted median.\n2. **Finding Weighted Median**: The total weight (sum of all `cost`) is computed. The code then traverses the sorted list, accumulating the costs. The point at which the cumulative cost meets or exceeds half the total weight identifies the target value (weighted median) that minimizes the total cost.\n3. **Calculating Total Cost**: After determining the target value, the code computes the total cost by summing the cost of adjusting each element to the target value. This involves multiplying the absolute difference between each element and the target by its respective cost per operation.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the target value to the weighted median, ensuring minimal total cost with optimal performance.",
