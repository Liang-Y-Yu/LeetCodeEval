      "Answer": "To solve this problem, we need to distribute candies to children standing in a line such that each child gets at least one candy and children with a higher rating than their neighbors get more candies. The goal is to find the minimum number of candies required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by giving each child one candy. This satisfies the condition that every child must have at least one candy.\n2. **Left Pass**: Traverse the ratings from left to right. For each child, if their rating is higher than the left neighbor, assign them one more candy than the left neighbor. This ensures that children with higher ratings than their left neighbor get more candies.\n3. **Right Pass**: Traverse the ratings from right to left. For each child, if their rating is higher than the right neighbor, but currently has fewer or equal candies, update their candies to be one more than the right neighbor. This ensures that children with higher ratings than their right neighbor get more candies.\n4. **Summation**: After both passes, sum up all the candies assigned to each child. The result is the minimum number of candies needed.\n\nThe idea is to first ensure the condition is satisfied from the left and then adjust from the right to meet both left and right conditions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(ratings)\n        candies = [1] * n\n        \n        for i in range(1, n):\n            if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]:\n                candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1\n        \n        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n            if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]:\n                if candies[i] <= candies[i+1]:\n                    candies[i] = candies[i+1] + 1\n        \n        return sum(candies)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by creating an array `candies` of the same length as `ratings`, initializing each value to 1. This ensures every child has at least one candy.\n2. **Left Pass**: We traverse from left to right (starting from index 1). For each child, if their rating is higher than the previous child, we set their candy count to one more than the previous child. This ensures the left neighbor condition is met.\n3. **Right Pass**: We traverse from right to left (starting from the second last element). For each child, if their rating is higher than the next child, and if their current candy count is not more than the next child's, we update their candy count to one more than the next child. This ensures the right neighbor condition is met without breaking the left condition.\n4. **Result**: The sum of all values in the `candies` array gives the minimum number of candies required to distribute.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures both conditions are satisfied with two linear passes through the array, resulting in an optimal solution with O(n) time and space complexity.",
