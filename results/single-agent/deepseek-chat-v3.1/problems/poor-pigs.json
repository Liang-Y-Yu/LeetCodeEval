      "Prompt": "Hi, this is a coding interview. You will be given:\n* A problem statement (with sample test cases if available).\n* A starter code snippet (with fixed function signatures).\n\nPlease write your solution in the python3 programming language. Your code must:\n* Solve the problem fully and correctly.\n* Pass all provided sample test cases.\n* Run within acceptable time and memory limits (assume large inputs if none are specified).\n* Follow good coding practices (clear logic, readable structure, appropriate use of language features).\n\nHere is the problem statement: There are buckets buckets of liquid, where exactly one of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have minutesToTest minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.\nYou can feed the pigs according to these steps:\n\tChoose some live pigs to feed.\n\tFor each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.\n\tWait for minutesToDie minutes. You may not feed any other pigs during this time.\n\tAfter minutesToDie minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.\n\tRepeat this process until you run out of time.\nGiven buckets, minutesToDie, and minutesToTest, return the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 15\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:\nAt time 0, feed the first pig buckets 1 and 2, and feed the second pig buckets 2 and 3.\nAt time 15, there are 4 possible outcomes:\n- If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous.\n- If only the second pig dies, then bucket 3 must be poisonous.\n- If both pigs die, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.\n- If neither pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous.\nExample 2:\nInput: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 30\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:\nAt time 0, feed the first pig bucket 1, and feed the second pig bucket 2.\nAt time 15, there are 2 possible outcomes:\n- If either pig dies, then the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.\n- If neither pig dies, then feed the first pig bucket 3, and feed the second pig bucket 4.\nAt time 30, one of the two pigs must die, and the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\t1 <= buckets <= 1000\n\t1 <=\u00a0minutesToDie <=\u00a0minutesToTest <= 100\n\nHere is the code snippet, which you should expand with your solution: class Solution:\n    def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:\n        \n\nImportant Requirements:\n* Do not change any provided function signatures, class names, or method names.\n* Output only valid source code that can be executed as-is, without any further improvements or bugfixes.\n* Do not include docstrings, markdown, or commentary in your final code.\n\nGood luck!\n",
