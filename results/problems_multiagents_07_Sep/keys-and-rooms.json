This is acceptable given the constraints.\n   - The space complexity is O(N) due to the use of a visited set and stack which at worst will contain all the rooms.\n\n4. **Code Quality**:\n   - The code is clean and follows good practices. It uses clear variable names and the logic is well-organized with consistent indentation.\n   - The use of a stack and set for DFS is appropriate for the problem.\n\n5. **Test Cases**:\n   - The provided examples when tested produce correct outputs, validating the implementation:\n     - For `rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]`, the output is `true`, indicating all rooms are accessible and visited.\n     - For `rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]`, the output is `false`, indicating room 2 cannot be reached.\n\n6. **Potential Issues**:\n   - There are no apparent bugs or logical errors in the current implementation.\n   - No improvements needed as the code performs well within given constraints.\n\nOverall, the implemented solution is correct and meets the problem requirements effectively. Here is the verified code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n        visited = set()\n        stack = [0]\n        \n        while stack:\n            room = stack.pop()\n            if room not in visited:\n                visited.add(room)\n                for key in rooms[room]:\n                    if key not in visited:\n                        stack.append(key)\n        \n        return len(visited) == len(rooms)\n```\n\n","TypedCode":"\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n        visited = set()\n        stack = [0]\n        \n        while stack:\n            room = stack.pop()\n            if room not in visited:\n                visited.add(room)\n                for key in rooms[room]:\n                    if key not in visited:\n                        stack.append(key)\n        \n        return len(visited) == len(rooms)\n","Model":"se-gpt-4o","Latency":7530438259,"SolvedAt":"2025-09-07T16:05:57.234288171+02:00","PromptTokens":3569,"OutputTokens":891}},"Submissions":{"se-gpt-4o":{"SubmitRequest":{"lang":"python3","question_id":"871","typed_code":"\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n        visited = set()\n        stack = [0]\n        \n        while stack:\n            room = stack.pop()\n            if room not in visited:\n                visited.add(room)\n                for key in rooms[room]:\n                    if key not in visited:\n                        stack.append(key)\n        \n        return len(visited) == len(rooms)\n"},"SubmissionId":1762750297,"CheckResponse":{"status_code":10,"status_msg":"Accepted","Finished":true,"State":"SUCCESS"},"SubmittedAt":"2025-09-07T16:29:17.654878163+02:00"}}}
