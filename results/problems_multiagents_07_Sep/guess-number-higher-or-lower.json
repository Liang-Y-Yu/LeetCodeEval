{"Question":{"Data":{"Question":{"questionFrontendId":"374","questionId":"374","Content":"<p>We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>I pick a number from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. You have to guess which number I picked (the number I picked stays the same throughout the game).</p>\n\n<p>Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.</p>\n\n<p>You call a pre-defined API <code>int guess(int num)</code>, which returns three possible results:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>-1</code>: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. <code>num &gt; pick</code>).</li>\n\t<li><code>1</code>: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. <code>num &lt; pick</code>).</li>\n\t<li><code>0</code>: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. <code>num == pick</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>the number that I picked</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example
